A look at some basic C++ code
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
#include <iostream> //enables program to output data

//main function begins program execution
int main () {
  //cout currently a function as a part of the std namespace
  std::cout << "Welcome to C++!\n";
  //above << is an insertion operator, overloaded from the bitwise left-shift

  return 0;
}
#+END_SRC

A look at some higher level C++ code
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
#include <iostream>

int main () {

  int num1{0}; //list initialization
  int num2 = 0; //regular initialization
 /*No difference between list & regular initializtion with primitive types. List initialization should be used for UDTs.*/

  int sum{0}

  std::cin >> num1;
  std::cin >> num2;

  sum = num1 + num2;

  std::cout << sum << std::endl;
  //endl is helpful because it flushes the buffer, which the newline character does not
  return 0;
}
#+END_SRC
