* Chapter 3
** Introduction
- Markets are any arrangements that enable buyers and sellers to get information
  and do business with each other
- Competitive Market: many buyers and many sellers so no single buyer or seller can
  influence prices
** Demand
- Reflects the buyers' side of the market
- If you demand something, you
  - want it
  - can afford it
  - have a definite plan to buy it
- Quantity demanded: amount that consumers plan to buy 
  during a particular time @ a particular price
- Law of Demand: other things remaining the same, the higher the price of a good, the smaller
  the quantity demanded (and vice versa)
- Substitution Effect: when the relative price of a good rises, people seek substitutes so
  the quantity demanded decreases
- When the price of a good rises relative to income, people cannot afford all the things
  they previously bought so quantity demanded decreases
- Demand Curve and Demand Schedule
  - the term demand refers to the entire relationship between good and quantity demanded
- Demand Curve: exhibits relationshit between quantity demanded and price when all other
  consumers' planned purchases remain constant
- Willingess and Ability to Pay
  - The smaller the quantity available, the higher the price someone is willing to pay for
    another unit
  - Willingness to pay measures marginal benefit
- Changes in Demand: when some influence on buying plans other than price changes, there is a
  shift in demand for that good
- 6 factors influencing demand:
  - Price of related goods
    - substitutes - good that can be used in place of another
    - complement - good that is used in conjunction with another
    - If $ substitute inc or $ complement dec, demand of good inc
    - if $ substitute dec or $ complement inc, demand of good dec
  - Expected future prices
    - if expected future price inc, current demand inc
    - if expected future price dec, current demand dec
  - Income
    - normal good: a good for which demand inc as income inc
    - inferior good: a good for which demand dec as income inc
    - if expected future income increases/credit is easier to get, current demand inc
  - Population
    - The higher the population, the higher the demand
  - Preferences
    - People with the same income have different demands if they have different preferences
** Supply
- If a firm is a supplier, they
  - have the resources and tech to produce it
  - can profit from producing it
  - has a definite plan to produce and sell it
- Quantity supplied: the amount producers plan to sell during a given time at a particular price
- Law of Supply: Other things remaning the same, the higher the price of a good, the greater the
  quantity supplied (and vice versa).
- Supply Curve and Supply Schedule
  - Minimum supply price: As quantity produced inc, marginal cost inc.
  - The lowest price at which someone is willing to sell an additional unit rises
  - This lowest price is called the marginal cost
- Changes in Supply
  - Increases in supply shifts the curve to the right (and vice versa)
- Factors that affect Supply
  - Prices of factors of production
    - If the price of an input inc, 
  - Prices of related goods produced
 * Chapter 1
** Scarcity
- all economic questions arise because we want more than we can get
- inability to satisfy all wants because of scarcity
- scarcity = limited resources
** Definition of Economics
- because we face scarcity, we must make choices
- incentive = a reward that encourages an action or a penalty that discourages an action
- economics is the social science that studies the choices that individuals, businesses, etc.
 make as they cope with scarcity and the incentives that influence and reconcile those choices
- Economics divides into two parts:
  - Microeconomics = study of choices that individuals and businesses make & how those choices
    interact with markets and the influence of governments
  - Macroeconomics = the study of the performance of national and global economies
** 6 Key Ideas
- a choice is a tradeoff: ever choice is an exchange giving up one thing for another
- making a rational choice: a rational choice compares costs and benefits, maximizing benefit
- benefit = what you gain: the gain or pleasure something brings about, determined by preferences
  - preferences = what a person likes, dislikes, and the intensity of those feelings
- cost = what must be given up
   - opportunity cost = highest val alternative that must be given up
- choosing at the margin: the benefit of pursuing an incremental increase in some action
  is marginal benefit of that action
  - the opportunity cost of pursuing an incremental increase in some action is marginal cost
  - if marginal benefit > marginal cost, rational choice is to do more of that action
- choices respond to incentives: a change in marginal cost/benefit changes our incentives & choices
** Positive & Normative
- economists distinguish between two types of statements: 
  - positive statements: can be tested by checking the facts
  - normative statements: express an untestable opinion
- economists as social scientists
  - economists test economic models
  - economic model = a description of some aspect of the world w only the necessary features
- economists as policy advisors
** Resources & Highest Valued Use
- the scope of economics: 
  - how do choices end up determining "what, how, and for whom" goods and services get produced
- goods and services are produced using productive resources called factors of production
  - land
  - labor
  - capital
  - entrepreneurship
- who gets goods and services depends on income
  - land earns rent, labor earns wages, capital earns interest, entrepreneruship earns profit
- **resources gravitate towards their highest value use** 
** Self Interest & Social Interest
- self interest = choices that are made because you think they are the best for you
- social interest = choices that are best for society as a whole
- social interest has two dimensions: 
  - efficiency: resource use is efficient if it is not possible to make someone better off without
    making someone else worse off (no waste to be eliminated)
  - fair shares/equity: refers to the fairness with which resource division occurs in a society
- tension between self & social interest: information revolution, climate change, globalization
