\section{10.05.20}
\label{sec:orgad7f873}
\begin{itemize}
\item Following widespread usage of antibiotics on humans and animals, waste from livestock and humans
is generating antibiotic-resistance bacteria
\item These bacteria are getting back into the environment through out waste
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Antibiotic Resistance is:}
\label{sec:orge5fc560}
\begin{itemize}
\item A complex problem that involves helping many actors see the big picture and not just their
part of it
\item Issues where an action affects (or is affected by) the environment surrounding the issue,
either the natural environment or the competitive environment
\item Problem whose solutions are not Obvious
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Systems Thinking}
\label{sec:orga57a76b}
\begin{itemize}
\item Considers the whole rather than parts of the whole:
\begin{itemize}
\item Events
\item Patterns
\item Underlying Structure
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Cycle of Infection}
\label{sec:org57cc5a9}
\begin{itemize}
\item Farm animals recieve antibiotics often, developing resistant bacteria in their gut
\item This can be transmitted through produce, waste, shared environments, etc.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Bacteria}
\label{sec:org0573d52}
\begin{itemize}
\item Bacteria are single celled organisms that can grow in colonies

\subsection{Hurricanes}
\label{sec:org080b131}
\subsubsection{How Hurricanes Form}
\label{sec:org34c2439}
\begin{itemize}
\item Water evaporates over the ocean and forms clouds when it touches cold air
\item A column of low pressure develops at the center with winds around the column
\item Speed of the wind around it increases
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Categorized based on wind speed (1-5)
\item Hurrican development requires warm water and low wind shear
\begin{itemize}
\item Carribean has warm water all year but also high wind shear which isn't conducive to hurricanes
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Climate Change \& Hurricanes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Storm surge more dangerous (accoutns for 90\% of hurricane deaths)
\item 40\% increase with a 0.5 decree C inc in temperature
\item Increasing of North Atlantic hurricane season
\item Climate change is expected to shift the Bermuda high westward
\begin{itemize}
\item Bermuda High is a pressure system over the Atlantic
\item Has the ability to move hurricanes on the Atlantic
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{09.11.20}
\label{sec:orgf95bc66}
\begin{itemize}
\item Northern latitudes experience greater seasonality in CO2 concentrations

\end{itemize}
\item Greenhouse effect
\begin{itemize}
\item Some incoming solar radiation is absorbed
\item Other amounts are reflected back into the atmosphere
\item Greenhouse gases capture and reradiate some heat over and over, warming the Earth
\item More gases, more heat
\end{itemize}
\item Albedo: measure of the reflectivity of a surface
\begin{itemize}
\item light surfaces have a higher albedo, darker surfaces have a lower albedo

\end{itemize}
\item Positive Feedback Loops
\begin{itemize}
\item applied to albedo:
\item temps rise -> more ice melting -> more water warming -> temps rise
\end{itemize}
\item Urban Heat Island Effect
\begin{itemize}
\item cities will be inc their population, inc energy and temperature
\item cities in particular have higher temperatures
\item tree cover -> cooler temperatures
\end{itemize}
\item Small changes in overall global temp can cause significant changes
in weather creating more extreme storms and more record temps
\begin{itemize}
\item roughly twice as many heat records
\item alterations in global jet streams
\item frost comes later and begins earlier
\end{itemize}
\item General climate change impacts:
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\item Women earning more money is correlated to lower child mortality
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Environmental Impact}
\label{sec:orgf253205}

the waste of, a person or population
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Sustainability}

\item The human population is rapidly increasing and the impact of humans is due to:
\begin{itemize}
\item More humans overall
\item Greater growth / person
\end{itemize}
\item To address population growth, we need to pursue a variety of approaches that address factors

\item Science is based on empirical evidence
\item Science allows us to test our ideas and evaluate the evidence
\item Scientific knowledge, including facts, theories, and laws, is subject to change
\item Scientific claims change as new evidence is made available
\end{itemize}

\item Infectious, fungal disease affecting amphibians
\item Helped understand white-nose syndrome with bats
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Science with WNS}
\label{sec:org3693d49}
\begin{itemize}
\item Scientific Method: the procedure used to empirically test a hypothesis
\begin{enumerate}
\item Observations generate questions
\item Choose a question to investigate
\item Consult literature
\item Develop a hypothesis and make a testable prediction
\item Design and carry out a study
\item Analyze data
\item Draw a conclusion
\end{enumerate}
\item Inferences: Conclusions drawn based on observations
\item Hypothesis: An inference that proposes possible explanation that includes previous knowledge/observation
\item Testing a Hypothesis: Hypotheses can be tested through an observational or experimental study
\item Scientific Studies: A fair test with results that could support or falsify the research prediction
\begin{itemize}
\item Experimental Studies: Conditions are manipulated intentionally
\begin{itemize}
\item Test Group: the group in an experimental study such that it differs from the control in only one way
\item Control Group: the group in an experimental study to which the test group's results are compared
\end{itemize}
\item Observational Studies: Gather real-world data without any intentional variable manipulation
\end{itemize}
\item Theory: A hypothesis that survives repeated testing by significant research can become a theory
\item Correlation v Causation
\begin{itemize}
\item Correlation: two things occuring together but not necessarily having a cause-effect relationship
\item Cause-Effect Relationship: the associationof a two variables that identifies one variable occurring
as a result of the other
\item Observational studies can derive correlation but not causation
\item Experimental studies can derive causational relationships
\end{itemize}
\item Policy: a formalized plan that addresses a desired outcome or goal
\begin{itemize}

\item Occurs when a large amount of people are using a shared resource
\item Seem good in the short term but are actually bad in the long term
\item 3 Types:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tragedy of the Commons: When resources are shared, individuals try to maximize personal
benefit which hurts the resource itself
\item Time delay: Collective decisions that are good today but gone tomorrow
\item Sliding reinforcer: related to the evolution of natural organisms and GMOs
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
