\section{10.07.20}
\label{sec:orgf02a2e7}
\subsection{Genetic Diversity \& Natural Selection}
\label{sec:orgb2be1ef}
\begin{itemize}
\item Genetic diversity in a population is the raw material natural selection
\item The larger the amount of genetic diversity, the higher probability that some individuals from
that pool can survive changes to its environment
\item Phenotype = expressed gene
\item Natural selection acts directly on the phenotype, resulting in changes in allele frequencies
from parental to offspring generations
\end{itemize}
\section{10.05.20}
\label{sec:org05e0ce9}
\begin{itemize}
\item Following widespread usage of antibiotics on humans and animals, waste from livestock and humans
is generating antibiotic-resistance bacteria

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Antibiotic Resistance:}
\label{sec:org7711351}
\begin{itemize}
\item A complex problem that involves helping many actors see the big picture and not just their
part of it
\item Issues where an action affects (or is affected by) the environment surrounding the issue,
either the natural environment or the competitive environment
\item Problem whose solutions are not Obvious
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Systems Thinking}
\label{sec:orgb3da1a1}
\begin{itemize}
\item Considers the whole rather than parts of the whole:
\begin{itemize}
\item Events
\item Patterns
\item Underlying Structure
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Cycle of Infection}
\label{sec:org8ab44e6}
\begin{itemize}
\item Farm animals recieve antibiotics often, developing resistant bacteria in their gut
\item This can be transmitted through produce, waste, shared environments, etc.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Bacteria}
\label{sec:org84f2257}
\begin{itemize}
\item Bacteria are single celled organisms that can grow in colonies
\item Many different kinds of bacteria can grow together in similar environments
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Explaining Resistance}
\label{sec:orge125174}
\begin{itemize}
\item Antibiotics kill almost all antibiotic sensitive bacteria, leaving few sensitive and many unsensitive
\item Reproduction occurs with the mostly-unsensitive remaining bacteria, leaving to many unsensitive off-
spring. This increases the amonut of resistant bacteria as a whole.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Genetic Variation}
\label{sec:org2673c3d}
\begin{itemize}
\item Variation in the susceptability of bacteria to antibiotics allows for the propogation of 
these genes in bacterial communities
\item Individuals of the same species have the same basic gene
\item Alleles: variants of genes that account for the diversity of traits seen in a populat
\item Adaptation: traits that promote the success of a species
\item An adaptive trait for one environmental condition does not mean that it is adaptive for all conditions
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Genetic Diversity}
\label{sec:org25961a0}
\begin{itemize}
\item Within populations, biodiversity is measured by genetic diversity
\item Genetic diversity improves survival of a population
\item Outbreeding, through sexual reproduction of not closely related individuals, maximizes genetic 
diversity
\item Inbreeding, or mating between closely related individuals, results from small 
populations, and increases chances of genetic diseases (e.g., hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, etc.)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Sources of Genetic Variation}
\label{sec:orgb02942b}
\begin{itemize}
\item Mutation: A change in the DNA sequence of sex cells that alter a gene
\begin{itemize}
\item Can be neutral, beneficial, or harmful
\end{itemize}
\item Genetic Recombination: The production of eggs and sperm that results in a shuffling of 
alleles, creating new combinations in offspring
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Natural Selection}
\label{sec:orgb66de6c}
\begin{itemize}
\item Constant struggle of organisms to survive and mate
\item Organisms tend to produce more offspring that can survive
\item Individuals of the same species are not identical
\item Evidence of Natural Selection: Selective breeding (artificial selection) of dogs and cats
\item Natural selection results in changes in gene frequencies
\begin{itemize}
\item Some individuals will be able to obtain more resources and can produce more offspring
\begin{itemize}
\item Differential reproductive success results in changes to gene frequencies
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\item Women earning more money is correlated to lower child mortality
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Environmental Impact}
\label{sec:org5c824fa}
\begin{itemize}
\item Slowing population growth is critical to sustainability and reducing our population impact
\item Our impact on the population is a result of (1) our population size and
(2) our consumption habits - both must be addressed
\item Ecological footprint: the land area needed to provide the resources for, and assimilate
the waste of, a person or population
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Sustainability}
\label{sec:org943ee65}
\begin{itemize}
\item A dynamic process between the economy, society, and environment
\item Sustainable: The process or the activity can be mantained without exhaustion or collapse
\begin{itemize}
\item Intra \& Inter-generational issue
\item Capacity of a system to accomodate changes:
\begin{itemize}
\item rates of renewable resource use should not exceed regeneration rate
\item rates of non-renewable resource use should not exceed rate of renewable substitute dev

\begin{itemize}
\item 3 major sparks of growth
\begin{itemize}
\item Agricultural Revolution
\item Industrual Revolution
\item Green Revolution
\end{itemize}
\item With more food and technology, the population and need for more human labor increased
\item The human population is rapidly increasing and the impact of humans is due to:
\begin{itemize}
\item More humans overall
\item Greater growth / person
\end{itemize}
\item To address population growth, we need to pursue a variety of approaches that address factors
encouraging high birth rates
\item Zero population growth: the absence of population growth, occurs when birth rates = death rates
\begin{itemize}
\item Replacement fertility is reached
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Population Ecology}
\label{sec:orgd7645eb}
\begin{itemize}
\item Analyze and categorize human populations using population ecology techniques
\item Population Ecology: a branch of biology dealing with the number of individuals
in a particular species in an area over time
\item Ecologists study populations to understand what makes them survive and thrive
\item Size, distribution, and growth rate is influenced by a variaty of factors and are important to 
understanding popilation ecology
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Monitoring Population Dynamics}
\label{sec:orgd8b6fbd}
\begin{itemize}
\item Population Dynamics: Changes over time in population size and composition
\item Important metrics:
\begin{itemize}
\item Minimum viable population - min number of individuals that would still allow population to persist or grow
\item Carrying Capacity (K) - the maximum population size that a particular environment can support indefinitely
\end{itemize}
\item Population Density - the overall desnity a particular populaiton can sustain
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Exponential Growth \& Populations}
\label{sec:org5e0d4cd}
\begin{itemize}
\item Exponential growth occurs in populations when growth is unrestricted. This is, overall, unsustainable
\item Growth which becomes progressively larger each breeding cycle

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Monitoring Population Growth}
\label{sec:org69f196c}
\begin{itemize}
\item Population growth rate - the rate at which a population of a species grows over time
\item Growth factors - factos which assist in the growth of a population
\item Resistance factors - factors which inhibit the growth of a population

in size below that level
\item Populations can only be regulated by density-dependent factors
\item Top down Regulation
\begin{itemize}
\item Predation
\item Disease
\end{itemize}
\item Bottom up Regulation
\begin{itemize}

\subsection{What is Science?}
\label{sec:org076fba0}
\begin{itemize}
\item Science: a body of knowledge that allows us to understand the world around us
\item Science is based on empirical evidence
\item Science allows us to test our ideas and evaluate the evidence
\item Scientific knowledge, including facts, theories, and laws, is subject to change
\item Scientific claims change as new evidence is made available
\end{itemize}
\subsection{White-Nose Syndrome Case Study}
\label{sec:org75394e3}
\subsubsection{About WNS}
\label{sec:org6086d53}
\begin{itemize}
\item White-Nose Syndrome
\begin{itemize}
\item 2007-2016, 6+ million bats dead as a result of White Nose Syndrome
\item The reason for the deaths was White-Nose Syndrome
\end{itemize}
\item Chytridiomycosis
\begin{itemize}
\item Infectious, fungal disease affecting amphibians
\item Helped understand white-nose syndrome with bats
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Science with WNS}
\label{sec:org79dbb22}
\begin{itemize}
\item Scientific Method: the procedure used to empirically test a hypothesis
\begin{enumerate}
\item Observations generate questions
\item Choose a question to investigate
\item Consult literature
\item Develop a hypothesis and make a testable prediction
\item Design and carry out a study
\item Analyze data
\item Draw a conclusion
\end{enumerate}
\item Inferences: Conclusions drawn based on observations
\item Hypothesis: An inference that proposes possible explanation that includes previous knowledge/observation
\item Testing a Hypothesis: Hypotheses can be tested through an observational or experimental study
\item Scientific Studies: A fair test with results that could support or falsify the research prediction
\begin{itemize}
\item Experimental Studies: Conditions are manipulated intentionally
\begin{itemize}
\item Test Group: the group in an experimental study such that it differs from the control in only one way
\item Control Group: the group in an experimental study to which the test group's results are compared
\end{itemize}
\item Observational Studies: Gather real-world data without any intentional variable manipulation
\end{itemize}
\item Theory: A hypothesis that survives repeated testing by significant research can become a theory
\item Correlation v Causation
\begin{itemize}
\item Correlation: two things occuring together but not necessarily having a cause-effect relationship
\item Cause-Effect Relationship: the associationof a two variables that identifies one variable occurring
as a result of the other
\item Observational studies can derive correlation but not causation
\item Experimental studies can derive causational relationships
\end{itemize}
\item Policy: a formalized plan that addresses a desired outcome or goal
\begin{itemize}
\item policies need to be flexible, adapt to new findings, address the environmental problem, fit social need
and be economically viable in order to work effectively.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Summary}
\label{sec:orgeaa8186}
\begin{itemize}
\item Scientific knowledge, through reliable and durable, is never absolute pr certain

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Social Traps}
\label{sec:org5f01c17}
\begin{itemize}
\item Occurs when a large amount of people are using a shared resource
\item Seem good in the short term but are actually bad in the long term
\item 3 Types:
\begin{itemize}
\item Tragedy of the Commons: When resources are shared, individuals try to maximize personal
benefit which hurts the resource itself
\item Time delay: Collective decisions that are good today but gone tomorrow
\item Sliding reinforcer: related to the evolution of natural organisms and GMOs
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Beginning with Data Interpretation}
\label{sec:org1d8fc34}
\begin{itemize}
\item Variables represent factors that can be manipulated, controlled, or merely measured for research
\item Variation = how much a variable changes
\item Independent var is controlled to see effects in the Dependent var
\item Graphs explore relationships with data and report this data
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Observational v Experimental Studies}
\label{sec:org42e4bf5}
\begin{itemize}
\item Observational studies can observe a correlation but are unable to derive a causational reln.
\item Experimental studies have a control var (required) and are able to derive causactional rlns.
