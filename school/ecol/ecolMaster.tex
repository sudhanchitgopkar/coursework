\label{sec:orgf238ae6}
\subsection{Locust Outbreaks}
\label{sec:org032229d}
\begin{itemize}
\item What triggers locust outbreaks?
\begin{itemize}
\item Locust outbreaks are caused by excessive rain, contributing to a moist area
\item Recent cyclones have contirbuted to very high amounts of recent rainfall
\end{itemize}
\item Why are they so devastating?
\begin{itemize}
\item A single locust can eat their own body weight (2g) per day, multiplied by the millions of locusts that comprise a single swarm
\end{itemize}
\item What can be done to help control outbreaks?
\begin{itemize}
\item Loud noises and preventing the locusts from laying their eggs is critical
\item Pesticide application and swarm location identification through an application
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Small Scale Farming and Food Security}
\label{sec:org8913998}
\begin{itemize}
\item Progress requires creating opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship
\item Increased public research and extension investment
\item Small scale sustainability poses challenging policy choices: payment for ecological services, decentralized governance systems, and technology choices
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Economics and the Environment}
\label{sec:orgb96fde6}
\begin{itemize}
\item Economics isn't just about money, it is also about the environmental resources we depend on
\begin{itemize}
\item Economics: the social science that deals with the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services
\end{itemize}
\item Environmental resources include ecosystem services
\begin{itemize}
\item Ecosystem services: essential ecological processes that make life on Earth possible
\end{itemize}
\item Environmental economists argue that mainstream economics will fail in the long run because it makes some assumptions that are inconsistent with the way nature operates.
\item When the price of a product doesn't reflect the external social and environmental costs, those costs are paid by people other than the consumer. Internalizing external costs better reflects the true cost of a product
\item Many US industries can't exist without illegal immigrants
\item Undocumented immigrants make up more than half of hired labors on farms, 15\% of construction workforce, 5\% of total workforce
\end{itemize}
\subsection{The Great Climate Migration}

\begin{itemize}
\item Africa also lacks food sovereignty
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Africa \& Hunger}
\label{sec:org2bc56be}
\begin{itemize}
\item Industrialization and farm subsidies enabled mostly US farmers to produce vast surpluses of what, corn, and soybeans
\item Global market flooded w cheap food
\item Smaller countries can't compete
\item Much of their farmable land used for cash crops, which are exported
\begin{itemize}
\item Cash crops: Food and fiber crops grown to sell for profit rather than for use by local families, communities
\end{itemize}

\item phsophorus critical to fertility, high crop yields, overall necessary to food production
\item phosphorus quickly becoming more expensive
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Major Issues Assiciated with Current Phosphorus Usage}
\label{sec:org20497f4}
\begin{itemize}
\item Inefficient global food system
\begin{itemize}
\item 4/5 of phosphorus is lost/wasted in the supply chain from mine to field to fork
\end{itemize}
\item Cheap fertilizer
\begin{itemize}
\item Farmers need access to phosphorus, yet up to 1B farmers lack access to fertilizer markets
\end{itemize}
\item No Monitoring
\begin{itemize}

\label{sec:org49496d0}
\begin{itemize}
\item Weathering = breakdown of rocks, soil, minerals often done by water or organisms
\begin{itemize}
\item Physical weathering = simply breaking down rocks
\item Chemical weathering - changing the chemical structure of rock, soil, etc
\end{itemize}
\item Makes up \textasciitilde{}50\% of the soil
\item Takes an extremely long time
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Soil Complexity}
\label{sec:orgc839689}
\begin{itemize}
\item Diverse organisms contribute to soil structure
\item Soil is often linked between the different spheres of the world and supports biodiversity significantly
\item Climate effects soil in different ways
\begin{itemize}
\item Tropical forest: generally infertile due to heavy rainfall and decomposition rates
\item Temperate forest: usually fertile and neutral to slightly aciding
\item Temperate grassland: neutral to slightly basic, high to moderate fertility
\item Desert: low fertility and organic magter, often high in salt content
\end{itemize}
\item It can take 500+ years for 2.5 cm of soil to form
\item Poor land use practices cause soil erosion
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Weathering vs Erosion}
\label{sec:orgde7e520}
\begin{itemize}
\item Weathering: the breakdown of rock to soil (creating soil)
\item Erosion: the movement of soil, minerals, etc to another place (taking away soil)
\item Overgrazing: removal of plant matter by livestock exposes soil to erosion
\item Deforestation exposes soil to loss
\item Desetification: Semiarid range land becomes permanently less productive when overgrazed
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Summary}
\label{sec:org0c5e468}
\begin{itemize}
\item There are biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems
\item Global biogeochemical cycles are essential to supportiong biology and the economy
\item Phosphorus is especially important. It is distributed heterogeneously and limitation of it may compromise agricultural production. An excess of phosphorus is a major quatic pollutant
\item Access to elements will govern patterns in economic and technological development
\item Soils are complex and take extremely long times to form. Soils are strongly influenced by climate.
\item A variety of activities compromise soils.

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Energy and Matter}
\label{sec:org8968a8a}
\begin{itemize}
\item All ecosystems function through:
\begin{itemize}
\item Matter cycles: movement of life's essential chemicals/nutrients through an ecosystem
\item Energy flow: the one-way passage of energy through an ecosystem
\end{itemize}
\item Earth is materially closed but energetically open
\item Biomass can't enter or leave the system, but energy can
\item Energy enters as sunlight through either heat or light
\item Photosynthesis: the chem eraction done by producers to convert energy of the sun using carbon dioxide and water -> sugar and oxygen
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Biomes}
\label{sec:org8415536}
\begin{itemize}
\item Biomes: specific portions of the biosphere determined by climate and identified by the predominant vegetation and organisms adapted to live there

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Nitrogen Cycle}
\label{sec:org9f51d86}
\begin{itemize}
\item Nitrogen is the most abundant gas in the air but has a very tight bond, bond must be broken (fixed) before use by producers
\item Nitrogen cal also be released back into the atmosphere
\item Nitrogen Cycle: a continuous series of natural processes by which nitrogen passes from air -> soil -> organisms -> air/soil
\item Nitrogen enters ecosystem through nitrogen fixation
\item Nitrogen exits the ecosystem when other bacteria convert nitrate back to molecular Nitrogen
\item Humans are disrupting the nitrogen cycle
\begin{itemize}
\item Fertilizers and emissions are doubling availbility of nitrogen
\item While nitrogen is no longer a limitng factor for plant growth, the additional notrigen can disrupt the ecosystem
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Phosphorus Cycle}
\label{sec:orgea0a112}
\begin{itemize}
\item Different than other cycles because phosporus doesn't exist in the atmosphere

\subsection{Explaining Resistance}
\label{sec:org5afb8fe}
\begin{itemize}
\item Antibiotics kill almost all antibiotic sensitive bacteria, leaving few sensitive and many unsensitive
\item Reproduction occurs with the mostly-unsensitive remaining bacteria, leaving to many unsensitive off-
spring. This increases the amonut of resistant bacteria as a whole.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Genetic Variation}
\label{sec:org723a858}
\begin{itemize}
\item Variation in the susceptability of bacteria to antibiotics allows for the propogation of 
these genes in bacterial communities

\subsubsection{Science with WNS}
\label{sec:org1815a64}
\begin{itemize}
\item Scientific Method: the procedure used to empirically test a hypothesis
\begin{enumerate}
\item Observations generate questions
\item Choose a question to investigate
\item Consult literature
\item Develop a hypothesis and make a testable prediction
\item Design and carry out a study
\item Analyze data
\item Draw a conclusion
\end{enumerate}
\item Inferences: Conclusions drawn based on observations
\item Hypothesis: An inference that proposes possible explanation that includes previous knowledge/observation
\item Testing a Hypothesis: Hypotheses can be tested through an observational or experimental study
\item Scientific Studies: A fair test with results that could support or falsify the research prediction
\begin{itemize}
\item Experimental Studies: Conditions are manipulated intentionally
\begin{itemize}
\item Test Group: the group in an experimental study such that it differs from the control in only one way
\item Control Group: the group in an experimental study to which the test group's results are compared
\end{itemize}
\item Observational Studies: Gather real-world data without any intentional variable manipulation
\end{itemize}
\item Theory: A hypothesis that survives repeated testing by significant research can become a theory
\item Correlation v Causation
\begin{itemize}
\item Correlation: two things occuring together but not necessarily having a cause-effect relationship
\item Cause-Effect Relationship: the associationof a two variables that identifies one variable occurring
as a result of the other
\item Observational studies can derive correlation but not causation
\item Experimental studies can derive causational relationships
\end{itemize}
\item Policy: a formalized plan that addresses a desired outcome or goal
\begin{itemize}
\item policies need to be flexible, adapt to new findings, address the environmental problem, fit social need
and be economically viable in order to work effectively.
