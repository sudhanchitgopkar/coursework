\label{sec:org96bc337}
\subsection{Triple Bottom Line}
\label{sec:org39d2c97}
\begin{itemize}
\item An assessment of the cost of a good or service should include more than just the economic costs; it should also include the social and environmental cost
\item IPAT Equation:
I = P * A * T; I = Impact, P = Population size, A = Affluence(products/person), T = Tech Usage (impact/product)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Assumptions of Mainstream Economics}
\label{sec:orgfafa209}
\begin{itemize}
\item Environmental economists argue that mainstream economics will fail in the long run because it makes some assumptions that are inconsistent with the way nature operates
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Assumption:
\label{sec:org34d6245}
\begin{itemize}
\item Natural and human resources are infinite, substitutes can be found as necessary
\item Economic growth will go on forever
\item Something that benefits/harms us today is more important than something that ight do so tomorrow
\end{itemize}
\item Impacts:
\label{sec:org4a5ddc3}
\begin{itemize}
\item Linear economic production models use inputs and produce waste without regard to sustainability; circular systems depend on renewable resources and see waste as a useful inp
\item Cradle to Cradle mentality creates sustainability whereas crade to grave increase the amount of overall waste
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Market solutions}
\label{sec:org671e1af}
\begin{itemize}
\item Alternatve: Command and Control
\begin{itemize}
\item Command = estbalishment of performance standards by a govt authority that must be complied with
\item Control = negative consequences that could result from non-compliance
\end{itemize}
\item Performance Standards
\item Tradeable permits
\begin{itemize}
\item Important to consider the effect on environmental justice
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Economic Incentives
\begin{itemize}
\item Seek to reduce or eliminate negative environmental externalities (such as pollution) by incorporating the external cost of production.
\item The general focus is prevention rather than remediation
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Payment for Ecosystem Services
\begin{itemize}
\item NYC protecting its water supply
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Environmental Policy}
\label{sec:org024489c}
\begin{itemize}
\item Environmental policy = A course of action adopted by a government or organization intended to improve the natural environment and public health and reduce human impact on the environment
\item Collective action undertaken to manage natural resources and human impacts on the environment.
\item Things like:
– Laws
– Regulations
– International agreements
– Funding decisions
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Why is Environmental Policy Challenging}
\label{sec:org57ed07b}
\begin{itemize}
\item Many environmental problems trasncend boundaries
\item Lots of WICKED problems, very complex with mulitple stakeholders
\item Lawmakers must juggle many factors
\begin{itemize}
\item Effectiveness of the policy
\item Negative tradeoffs
\item Cost burden (internal, external costs)
\item Flexibility of the policy to accomodate changes
\end{itemize}
\item Many times, voters and lawmakers don't agree that they are necessary
\end{itemize}
\subsection{History of Environmental Policy}
\label{sec:org51700ba}
\begin{itemize}
\item Before 1960's
\begin{itemize}
\item How best to use resources
\item Pollution not key objective
\item Primerily dealt with at the state level
\item Environmental problems addressed after the fact through litigation, favored the pollutor
\end{itemize}
\item Changes
\begin{itemize}
\item As industry, pollution inc, pollution crossed state lines
\item Massive outcry in the 60's and 70's lef to federal legislation
\item Performance standards let to a prevention-focused regulation
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Who Makes Environmentla Policy?}
\label{sec:orgf27680c}
\begin{itemize}
\item Elected Officials
\item Federal and State Agencies
\item Local departments: planning and zoning, public works, etc/
\item Courts
\item Corporations and other businesses
\end{itemize}
\subsection{NEPA}
\label{sec:org1614797}
\begin{itemize}
\item NEPA’s key feature is the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)—a report that details the likely impacts (positive and negative) of a proposed action.
\item The goal of an EIS is to identify problems before they occur so that stakeholders can choose the most acceptable course of action.
\item The findings are made available to everyone (citizens, policy makers, and special interest groups)—this keeps the process transparent and everyone is given a chance to respon
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Policy Decision Making Process}
\label{sec:orgfef3257}
\begin{itemize}
\item Identify problem -> Consider options -> Formulate Plan -> Adopt Law -> Implement Law
-> Evaluate effectiveness
\item Statutes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Provide policies, goals
\item Typically mandate an agency to promulgate regulations according to staturoy standards and enforce them
\item Often authorize states to enforce them
\item Often dictate funding allocations
\end{itemize}
\item Regulations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Regulation = rule = administrative law
\item The actual technical and programmatic standards for environmental protection
\item Standards usually in regulagtions instead of statutes because of ease of amendment
\end{itemize}
\item Court Decisions
\begin{itemize}
\item Rule on constitutionality of statute, regulation, or other deferal action
\item Rule on application of statue or regulation
\item Rule on meaning (language/intent)
\end{itemize}
\item Executive Orders
\begin{itemize}
\item Presidential directives to do something
\item Often involve internal affairs, Development of amendments to regulations
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Misc}
\label{sec:orgcf7ae65}
\begin{itemize}
\item Most environmental regulation passed between the 70's and 90's, no significant regulation since
\item Enforcement and Definitions absolutely essential
\item Trump and Environmental Policy
\begin{itemize}
\item Treaties
\end{itemize}
– Paris Climate Agreement
\begin{itemize}
\item Agency heads, federal judges
\item Agency directives –rules/regulations
\item Rule rollbacks
\item No new rules or policies
\item More state authority
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Spread of Disease}
\label{sec:org6aa7808}
\begin{itemize}
\item Increased connectivity increases rate and spread of infectious diseases across the globe
\item Correlation between travel advisory and amount of travel to infected areas for Zika
\item Zika most likely to be found in the Southeast because of Zika-transmitting mosquito population residence
\item High poverty rates correlated with high risk of disease spread due to high population density, potential lack of good healthcare

\item The Southeast US is a global hotspot of freshwater biodiversity supporting 2/3 of the country's fish species, over 90\% of the US total species of mussels and nearly half of the global total of crayfish species
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Habitat v Niche}
\label{sec:org3345b71}
\begin{itemize}
\item Habitat: the physical location of an species

\end{itemize}
\section{10.09.20}
\label{sec:org57fae86}

\section{10.07.20}
\label{sec:org9c1a62d}
\subsection{Genetic Diversity \& Natural Selection}
\label{sec:org7f59358}
\begin{itemize}
\item Genetic diversity in a population is the raw material natural selection
\item The larger the amount of genetic diversity, the higher probability that some individuals from
that pool can survive changes to its environment
\item Phenotype = expressed gene
\item Natural selection acts directly on the phenotype, resulting in changes in allele frequencies
from parental to offspring generations
\end{itemize}
\section{10.05.20}
\label{sec:org1f67432}
\begin{itemize}
\item Following widespread usage of antibiotics on humans and animals, waste from livestock and humans
is generating antibiotic-resistance bacteria

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Antibiotic Resistance:}
\label{sec:org7dd8319}
\begin{itemize}
\item A complex problem that involves helping many actors see the big picture and not just their
part of it
\item Issues where an action affects (or is affected by) the environment surrounding the issue,
either the natural environment or the competitive environment
\item Problem whose solutions are not Obvious
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Systems Thinking}
\label{sec:org9c5ef7a}
\begin{itemize}
\item Considers the whole rather than parts of the whole:
\begin{itemize}
\item Events
\item Patterns
\item Underlying Structure
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Cycle of Infection}
\label{sec:org8a850ef}
\begin{itemize}
\item Farm animals recieve antibiotics often, developing resistant bacteria in their gut
\item This can be transmitted through produce, waste, shared environments, etc.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Bacteria}
\label{sec:org62083ad}
\begin{itemize}
\item Bacteria are single celled organisms that can grow in colonies
\item Many different kinds of bacteria can grow together in similar environments
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Explaining Resistance}
\label{sec:org9a1f404}
\begin{itemize}
\item Antibiotics kill almost all antibiotic sensitive bacteria, leaving few sensitive and many unsensitive
\item Reproduction occurs with the mostly-unsensitive remaining bacteria, leaving to many unsensitive off-
spring. This increases the amonut of resistant bacteria as a whole.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Genetic Variation}
\label{sec:org26b0b08}
\begin{itemize}
\item Variation in the susceptability of bacteria to antibiotics allows for the propogation of 
these genes in bacterial communities
\item Individuals of the same species have the same basic gene
\item Alleles: variants of genes that account for the diversity of traits seen in a populat
\item Adaptation: traits that promote the success of a species
\item An adaptive trait for one environmental condition does not mean that it is adaptive for all conditions
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Genetic Diversity}
\label{sec:org049e6ec}
\begin{itemize}
\item Within populations, biodiversity is measured by genetic diversity
\item Genetic diversity improves survival of a population
\item Outbreeding, through sexual reproduction of not closely related individuals, maximizes genetic 
diversity
\item Inbreeding, or mating between closely related individuals, results from small 
populations, and increases chances of genetic diseases (e.g., hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, etc.)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Sources of Genetic Variation}
\label{sec:orgd520252}
\begin{itemize}
\item Mutation: A change in the DNA sequence of sex cells that alter a gene
\begin{itemize}
\item Can be neutral, beneficial, or harmful
\end{itemize}
\item Genetic Recombination: The production of eggs and sperm that results in a shuffling of 
alleles, creating new combinations in offspring
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Natural Selection}
\label{sec:orgcbd49ff}
\begin{itemize}
\item Constant struggle of organisms to survive and mate
\item Organisms tend to produce more offspring that can survive
\item Individuals of the same species are not identical
\item Evidence of Natural Selection: Selective breeding (artificial selection) of dogs and cats
\item Natural selection results in changes in gene frequencies
\begin{itemize}
\item Some individuals will be able to obtain more resources and can produce more offspring
\begin{itemize}
\item Differential reproductive success results in changes to gene frequencies
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hurricanes}
\label{sec:org7d71c78}
\subsubsection{How Hurricanes Form}
\label{sec:org4d8b768}
\begin{itemize}

\item Speed of the wind around it increases
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Categorized based on wind speed (1-5)
\item Hurrican development requires warm water and low wind shear
\begin{itemize}
\item Carribean has warm water all year but also high wind shear which isn't conducive to hurricanes
