** Definitions of Diversity
- Genetic Diversity: Variations in the genes among individuals of the same species
- Species Diversity: The variety of species present in an area; includes the number of different species that are present as well as their relative abundance
- Ecological Diversity: The variety of habitats, niches, trophic levels, and community interactions
** Robust Redhorse
- Thought to be extinct until rediscovered in the Oconee in 1991
- Extripated: Extinct in a local area
** Species Diversity
- Richness: number of different species
- Evenness: relative abundance of each species
- Diversity: combined richness and evenness
** Endemic Species
- Because areas w high ecological diversity offer many habitats and niches, they have a large number of endemic species
- Endemic species: a species that is native to a particular area and not usually found elsewhere
  - Most commonly found in small ecosystems
** Hotspots
- Biodiversity hotspots: areas that have high endemism and have lost at least 70% of their original habitat
- These areas contain a large number of endangered species (species at high risk of becoming extinct)
- The Southeast US is a global hotspot of freshwater biodiversity supporting 2/3 of the country's fish species, over 90% of the US total species of mussels and nearly half of the global total of crayfish species
** Habitat v Niche
- Habitat: the physical location of an species
- Niche: the biotic and abiotic needs for a species to survive
** Biodiversity Loss
- As much as 20% of the world's biodiversity may be lost in the next 30 years
- 50-66% of biodiversity may be lost by the end of the century
- Current rate of extinction is 1500 times greater than pre-human background rate
** Causes of Biodiversity Loss
- Human actions are having significant impacts on biodiversity loss
- Threats include:
  - Habitat destruction
  - Invasive Species introduction
  - Pollution
  - Overharvesting
  - Climate change
** Value of Biodiversity
- Provides key connections between species and their environment
- Provides direct protection against disease
- Provide food, fuel, building materials, and pharmaceuticals
** Ecosystem Services
- Supportive Services:
  - Purification of air and water
  - Carbon sequestration
  - Erosion Prevention
  - Habitats for animals and Plants
- Provisioning Services: Food, resources, water, fuel
- Regulating Services: Pollination, seed dispersal, protection, biological control
- Cultural Services: Recreation, Spiritual Tourism, mental health
- Human Wellbeing:
  - Strong economic growth
  - Medicinal resources
  - Reduction in toxin exposure
** Isolation and Extinction Risk
- Number of unique species increases with isolation
  - Isolation and high endemism makes remote islands particularly vulnerable to species loss
  - Human impact contributes to isolation in the form of habitat fragmentation
  - Habitat fragmentation: destruction of part of an area that creates a patchwork of suitable and unsuitable havitat areas that may exclude some species altogether
* 10.09.20
** Evolution and Resistance
- Evolution happens to populations, not individuals
- Natural selection is the mechanism for evolution
- Genetic drift more likely with low population size
- The potential for antibiotic resistance to develop in bacteria is very high
- Improper waste disposal
** Athens Water Quality
- 10/17 Athens watershed are impaired or unhealthy
- Athens drinking water comes from:
  - N Oconee River
  - Middle Oconee River
  - Cedar Creek
- Athens had E. Coli outbreaks in water, showing prevalence of bacteria
** Gonnorhea & Resistance
- Gonorrhea treatment is done through antibiotics
- Shown increase in resistance to every drug used to treat Gonnorhea
- CDC currently recommending two-drug comination to preserve our last
  highly effective antibiotic
- Higher reported rates of Gonnorhea occur in SE US, on an overall upward
  trend with younger populations
** Developing new Antibiotics
- First antibiotic developed by Alexander Fleming in 1982 after noticing the fungus penicillium could kill disease causing bacteria
- Antibiotics aren't profitable for drug companies
- Developing antibiotics are high risk, very expensive, and very difficult
- Low return on investment, development void since 1990
** Post-antibiotic Era
- Currently:
  - 80% of gonnorhea infections now resistant to antibiotics- 440,000 new cases of resistant tuberculosis annually
- In the future
  - Strep throats to scraped knees could be deadly
  - Cost to treat drug resistant double that of the status quo
- Davos Declaration
  - Reducing the development of drug resistance.
  - Increasing investment in R&D that meets global public health needs.
  - Improve access to high-quality antibiotics for all.
  - Signed by 98 companies, 11 industrial associations in 21 countries
* 10.07.20
** Genetic Diversity & Natural Selection
- Genetic diversity in a population is the raw material natural selection
- The larger the amount of genetic diversity, the higher probability that some individuals from
  that pool can survive changes to its environment
- Phenotype = expressed gene
- Natural selection acts directly on the phenotype, resulting in changes in allele frequencies
  from parental to offspring generations
* 10.05.20
- Following widespread usage of antibiotics on humans and animals, waste from livestock and humans
  is generating antibiotic-resistance bacteria
- These bacteria are getting back into the environment through out waste
** Antibiotic Resistance:
- A complex problem that involves helping many actors see the big picture and not just their
  part of it
- Issues where an action affects (or is affected by) the environment surrounding the issue,
  either the natural environment or the competitive environment
- Problem whose solutions are not Obvious
** Systems Thinking
- Considers the whole rather than parts of the whole:
  - Events
  - Patterns 
  - Underlying Structure
** Cycle of Infection
- Farm animals recieve antibiotics often, developing resistant bacteria in their gut
- This can be transmitted through produce, waste, shared environments, etc.
** Bacteria
- Bacteria are single celled organisms that can grow in colonies
- Many different kinds of bacteria can grow together in similar environments
** Explaining Resistance
- Antibiotics kill almost all antibiotic sensitive bacteria, leaving few sensitive and many unsensitive
- Reproduction occurs with the mostly-unsensitive remaining bacteria, leaving to many unsensitive off-
  spring. This increases the amonut of resistant bacteria as a whole.
** Genetic Variation
- Variation in the susceptability of bacteria to antibiotics allows for the propogation of 
  these genes in bacterial communities
- Individuals of the same species have the same basic gene
- Alleles: variants of genes that account for the diversity of traits seen in a populat
- Adaptation: traits that promote the success of a species
- An adaptive trait for one environmental condition does not mean that it is adaptive for all conditions
** Genetic Diversity
- Within populations, biodiversity is measured by genetic diversity
- Genetic diversity improves survival of a population
- Outbreeding, through sexual reproduction of not closely related individuals, maximizes genetic 
  diversity
- Inbreeding, or mating between closely related individuals, results from small 
  populations, and increases chances of genetic diseases (e.g., hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, etc.)
** Sources of Genetic Variation
- Mutation: A change in the DNA sequence of sex cells that alter a gene
  - Can be neutral, beneficial, or harmful
- Genetic Recombination: The production of eggs and sperm that results in a shuffling of 
  alleles, creating new combinations in offspring
** Natural Selection
- Constant struggle of organisms to survive and mate
- Organisms tend to produce more offspring that can survive
- Individuals of the same species are not identical
- Evidence of Natural Selection: Selective breeding (artificial selection) of dogs and cats
- Natural selection results in changes in gene frequencies
  - Some individuals will be able to obtain more resources and can produce more offspring
   - Differential reproductive success results in changes to gene frequencies
* 09.18.20
** Hurricanes
*** How Hurricanes Form
  - Water evaporates over the ocean and forms clouds when it touches cold air
  - A column of low pressure develops at the center with winds around the column
  - Speed of the wind around it increases
- Categorized based on wind speed (1-5)
- Hurrican development requires warm water and low wind shear
  - Carribean has warm water all year but also high wind shear which isn't conducive to hurricanes
*** Climate Change & Hurricanes
- Storm surge more dangerous (accoutns for 90% of hurricane deaths)
- 40% increase with a 0.5 decree C inc in temperature
- Increasing of North Atlantic hurricane season
- Climate change is expected to shift the Bermuda high westward
  - Bermuda High is a pressure system over the Atlantic
  - Has the ability to move hurricanes on the Atlantic
*** Hurricane Harvey Intensification
  - Went from a tropical depression to a Cat 4 Hurricane in 57 hours
  - Soil in TX affected the amount of water maintained in the Earth
  - Huge economic impacts
*** General Impacts
  - Storm Surge
  - Extreme Rainfall
  - Potential Wind Speed
* 09.16.20
** Heat Waves
- Heat extremes doubled in frequency from 1980-1999 to 2000-2019
- Climate change affecting heat waves
  - Shifting the frequency of hot and cold weather, heat waves are more frequent
  - Exacerbating heat inducing droughts, dry land leads to even hotter temps
- Causes: Global warming ->
  - Large scale global circulation change
  - Atmospheric Blocking increase
  - Air mass temp increase
- Effects and Consequences
  - Decreased human productivity
  - Increased tropical disease and death
  - Environmental racism
  - Crop productivity decreases
  - Lower biodiversity
  - Decreased water availability
  - Increased fire risk
** Wildfires
- Climate change is increasing the size, intensity, and frequency of wildfires
- Wildfires create more cimate change through the increase of carbon expulsion through wildfires
- Wildfires have global impacts due to smoke and temperature changes
- Wildfire season has gotten longer due to climate change 
* 09.14.20
** Coriolis Effect
- Deflection of an object's path due to the rotation of the Earth
- North and south poles have different deflections of wind patterns
- Little/no deflection at the equator
** Air circulation
- Hottest air at the equator, moves north or south, cools, then comes back into equator
*** Cells
- Hadley cells: 0-30 degrees North and South
- Ferrell Cell: 30-60 degrees North
- Polar cells: North and South poles
- Northeast and Southeast trade winds (remember directions!)
- Westerlies: bring rain and precipitation
** Surface Ocean Currents
- Ocean currents also affect the distribution of climates
- Surface ocean currents generated by wind, Coriolis effect, heat, and continents
- Heat redistribution from the Tropics
  - Trade winds push warm surface waters west
  - Water reaches continents and flows north and south
  - water cools
  - Westerlies push cooler water east
  - Water reaches continents and flows to equator
** El Nino (Southern Oscillation)
- Recurring climate pattern involving changes in the termperature of waters in the central
    and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.
- The ocean and atmosphere can interact to affect climate
  - Water in the eastern pacific warms up
  - Sea level pressure drops but rises in the W pacific
  - Trade winds weaken
  - Upwelling in the Pacific is reduced
  - Warmer waters - increased rainfall in Peru
  - Cooler waters, drought in Australia/Indonesia
- Critical because of its ability to change atmospheric circulation, temps, and percipitation
- Significantly hurts fisheries and developing countries
** La Nina
- exacerbates normal conditions and leads to cooling in the Eastern pacific
** Heat Waves 
- Global warming has amplified the intensity, duration, and frequency of 
  extreme heat and heat waves. 
* 09.11.20
- Northern latitudes experience greater seasonality in CO2 concentrations
  - This is due to variation in photosynthetic activity by plants
- Greenhouse effect
  - Some incoming solar radiation is absorbed
  - Other amounts are reflected back into the atmosphere
  - Greenhouse gases capture and reradiate some heat over and over, warming the Earth
  - More gases, more heat
- Albedo: measure of the reflectivity of a surface
  - light surfaces have a higher albedo, darker surfaces have a lower albedo
  - surfaces with a low albedo release more heat into the atmosphere
- Positive Feedback Loops
  - applied to albedo:
  - temps rise -> more ice melting -> more water warming -> temps rise
- Urban Heat Island Effect
  - cities will be inc their population, inc energy and temperature
  - cities in particular have higher temperatures
  - tree cover -> cooler temperatures
- Small changes in overall global temp can cause significant changes
  in weather creating more extreme storms and more record temps
  - roughly twice as many heat records
  - alterations in global jet streams
  - frost comes later and begins earlier
- General climate change impacts:
  - Health impacts
  - Crop productivity
  - Coastal erosion
  - Biodiversity
  - Water availability
  - Fire risk
- Weather events getting more extreme with
  - sea levels
  - wildfires
- Need both adaptation and mitigation
  - Adaptation: Responding to warming that has already happened
  - Mitigation: Preventing further warming by addressing climate change causes
* 09.09.20
** The Earth's Atmoshphere
- Climate change is a serious environmental problem impacting species, ecosystems, and the globe
- The atmosphere helps protect the Earth from the sun and keeps the temperature of the Earth cool
- Atmosphere has a significant impact on climate
- Earth's Atmosphere Composition
  - Nitrogen (78%)
  - Oxygen (21%)
  - Other - Greenhouse Gases (1%)
** The Keeling Curve
- Curve developed to track atmospheric CO2 levels in Earth's atmosphere since 1952
* 09.02.20
** Demographic Transition Model
- Demographers use age structure diagrams to predict future growth potential of a population
  - Pyramid structures indicate fast growth
  - House-shaped structures have moderate growth
  - Diamond structures have low/negative growth
- Development leads to smaller families
- Demographic transitions happen country by country
- Industrialization might not lead to a demographic transition in all countries
  - May not be linked to quality of life
  - Religion/Cultural beliefs
  - Social justice issue, improving the well-being of women and children key to dec. fertility
** Social Justice: Education for Women
- Education of girls & economic opportunities for women are correlated with lower birth rates
- Education empowers women to take control over thri own fertility through: 
  - Birth control
  - Marrying later
  - Delaying childbirth for career opportunities
- Women earning more money is correlated to lower child mortality
** Environmental Impact
- Slowing population growth is critical to sustainability and reducing our population impact
- Our impact on the population is a result of (1) our population size and
 (2) our consumption habits - both must be addressed
- Ecological footprint: the land area needed to provide the resources for, and assimilate
  the waste of, a person or population
** Sustainability
- A dynamic process between the economy, society, and environment
- Sustainable: The process or the activity can be mantained without exhaustion or collapse
  - Intra & Inter-generational issue
  - Capacity of a system to accomodate changes:
    - rates of renewable resource use should not exceed regeneration rate
    - rates of non-renewable resource use should not exceed rate of renewable substitute dev
    - rates of pollution should not exceed ssimilative capacity of the environment
- Sustainable development has three factors:
  - Social equity
  - Economic efficiency
  - Environmental responsibility
** Worldviews
- Culture influences our beliefs through:
  - Knowledge
  - Beliefs
  - Values
  - Learned ways of life
- Worldviews are affected by: 
  - Environmental Ethics
* 08.31.20
** Human Populations
- 3 major sparks of growth
  - Agricultural Revolution
  - Industrual Revolution
  - Green Revolution
- With more food and technology, the population and need for more human labor increased
- The human population is rapidly increasing and the impact of humans is due to:
  - More humans overall
  - Greater growth / person
- To address population growth, we need to pursue a variety of approaches that address factors
  encouraging high birth rates
- Zero population growth: the absence of population growth, occurs when birth rates = death rates
  - Replacement fertility is reached
** Population Ecology
- Analyze and categorize human populations using population ecology techniques
- Population Ecology: a branch of biology dealing with the number of individuals
  in a particular species in an area over time
- Ecologists study populations to understand what makes them survive and thrive
- Size, distribution, and growth rate is influenced by a variaty of factors and are important to 
  understanding popilation ecology
** Monitoring Population Dynamics
- Population Dynamics: Changes over time in population size and composition
- Important metrics:
  - Minimum viable population - min number of individuals that would still allow population to persist or grow
  - Carrying Capacity (K) - the maximum population size that a particular environment can support indefinitely
- Population Density - the overall desnity a particular populaiton can sustain
** Exponential Growth & Populations
- Exponential growth occurs in populations when growth is unrestricted. This is, overall, unsustainable
- Growth which becomes progressively larger each breeding cycle
- Produces a J curve when plotted
** Monitoring Population Growth
- Population growth rate - the rate at which a population of a species grows over time
- Growth factors - factos which assist in the growth of a population
- Resistance factors - factors which inhibit the growth of a population
- Limiting factos: resources needed for survival but that may be in short supply
** Logistic Growth
- Occurs when a population nears carrying capacity (k) 
  - Maximum sustainable population size
  - Determined by limiting factors
** Density-dependent/ Density-independent Factors
- Density dependent factors increase as populations grow, typically biotic
  - Disease
  - Competition
  - Predation
- Density independent facts affect population growth regardless of population size
  - Storm
  - Fire/Flood
  - Avalanche
** Regulation
- Tendency for populations to decrease in size when above acertain level, and increase
  in size below that level
- Populations can only be regulated by density-dependent factors
- Top down Regulation
  - Predation
  - Disease
- Bottom up Regulation
  - Nutrients
  - Water
  - Sunlight

** What is Science?
- Science: a body of knowledge that allows us to understand the world around us
- Science is based on empirical evidence
- Science allows us to test our ideas and evaluate the evidence
- Scientific knowledge, including facts, theories, and laws, is subject to change
- Scientific claims change as new evidence is made available
** White-Nose Syndrome Case Study
*** About WNS
- White-Nose Syndrome
  - 2007-2016, 6+ million bats dead as a result of White Nose Syndrome
  - The reason for the deaths was White-Nose Syndrome
- Chytridiomycosis
  - Infectious, fungal disease affecting amphibians
  - Helped understand white-nose syndrome with bats
*** Science with WNS
- Scientific Method: the procedure used to empirically test a hypothesis
  1. Observations generate questions
  2. Choose a question to investigate
  3. Consult literature
  4. Develop a hypothesis and make a testable prediction
  5. Design and carry out a study
  6. Analyze data
  7. Draw a conclusion
- Inferences: Conclusions drawn based on observations
- Hypothesis: An inference that proposes possible explanation that includes previous knowledge/observation
- Testing a Hypothesis: Hypotheses can be tested through an observational or experimental study
- Scientific Studies: A fair test with results that could support or falsify the research prediction
  - Experimental Studies: Conditions are manipulated intentionally
    - Test Group: the group in an experimental study such that it differs from the control in only one way
    - Control Group: the group in an experimental study to which the test group's results are compared 
  - Observational Studies: Gather real-world data without any intentional variable manipulation
- Theory: A hypothesis that survives repeated testing by significant research can become a theory
- Correlation v Causation
  - Correlation: two things occuring together but not necessarily having a cause-effect relationship
  - Cause-Effect Relationship: the associationof a two variables that identifies one variable occurring
    as a result of the other
  - Observational studies can derive correlation but not causation
  - Experimental studies can derive causational relationships
- Policy: a formalized plan that addresses a desired outcome or goal
  - policies need to be flexible, adapt to new findings, address the environmental problem, fit social need
    and be economically viable in order to work effectively.
** Summary
- Scientific knowledge, through reliable and durable, is never absolute pr certain
- This knowledge, including facts, theories, and laws, is subject to change
- Physical evidence, systematically collected and logically analyzed, helps scientists
  understand environmental issues and guide policy decisions
* 08.25.20
** Applied v Empirical Science
- Applied Science = research whose findings are used to solve practical problems
- Empirical science: A scientific approach that investigates the natural world through case studies
** Social Traps
- Occurs when a large amount of people are using a shared resource
- Seem good in the short term but are actually bad in the long term
- 3 Types:
  - Tragedy of the Commons: When resources are shared, individuals try to maximize personal
    benefit which hurts the resource itself
  - Time delay: Collective decisions that are good today but gone tomorrow
  - Sliding reinforcer: related to the evolution of natural organisms and GMOs
** Beginning with Data Interpretation 
- Variables represent factors that can be manipulated, controlled, or merely measured for research
- Variation = how much a variable changes
- Independent var is controlled to see effects in the Dependent var
- Graphs explore relationships with data and report this data
** Observational v Experimental Studies
- Observational studies can observe a correlation but are unable to derive a causational reln.
- Experimental studies have a control var (required) and are able to derive causactional rlns.
* 08.24.20
** Definitions
- Ecology: the branch of science dealing with the relationships of living things to one another & the environment
- Environmental Science: The study of all aspects of the environment, including physical, chemical, and biological factos, particularly with respect to how these aspects affect humans, and vice versa
- Environmental Ethics: Personal philosophy that influences how a person interacts with their natural environment and thus influences how one responds to environmental problems
** Ecology != Environmentalism
- Distinguish between envrironmentalism & ecology

| Environmentalism                    | Ecology                                          |
