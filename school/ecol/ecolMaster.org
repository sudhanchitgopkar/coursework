** Applied v Empirical Science
- Applied Science = research whose findings are used to solve practical problems
- Empirical science: A scientific approach that investigates the natural world through case studies

** Social Traps
- Occurs when a large amount of people are using a shared resource
- Seem good in the short term but are actually bad in the long term
- 3 Types:
  - Tragedy of the Commons: When resources are shared, individuals try to maximize personal
    benefit which hurts the resource itself
  - Time delay: Collective decisions that are good today but gone tomorrow
  - Sliding reinforcer: related to the evolution of natural organisms and GMOs

** Beginning with Data Interpretation 
- Variables represent factors that can be manipulated, controlled, or merely measured for research
- Variation = how much a variable changes
- Independent var is controlled to see effects in the Dependent var
- Graphs explore relationships with data and report this data

** Observational v Experimental Studies
- Observational studies can observe a correlation but are unable to derive a causational reln.
- Experimental studies have a control var (required) and are able to derive causactional rlns.

** Definitions
- Ecology: the branch of science dealing with the relationships of living things to one another & the environment
- Environmental Science: The study of all aspects of the environment, including physical, chemical, and biological factos, particularly with respect to how these aspects affect humans, and vice versa
- Environmental Ethics: Personal philosophy that influences how a person interacts with their natural environment and thus influences how one responds to environmental problems

** Ecology != Environmentalism
- Distinguish between envrironmentalism & ecology
| Environmentalism                    | Ecology                                          |
| Activism to protect the environment | Scientific study of living and non-living things |
