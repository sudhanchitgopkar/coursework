\section{Session 2}
\label{sec:org024b3ba}
\subsection{Speech 1}
\label{sec:org7abbab9}
\begin{itemize}
\item Being a good Athenian that helps your state and is just in your actions is all that is truly
required of citizens
\item Must share the beauty of Athens unto everyone
\item Currently have low population post-30;
\item Our loyalty must be firstly to the gods and to Athens, doing so requires us to bestow citizenship
upon those that deserve it
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Speech 2}
\label{sec:orgc8d7214}
\begin{itemize}
\item Metics and slaves can't be trusted to put Athens above themselves
\item Slaves fled at the first opportunity during the Peloponnesian War
\item We must focus on restoring Athens - if slaves were given freedom and the ability to vote,
many shops would close and our economy would decline
\item Must not make drastic changes at such a vulnerable time
\item Some metics were helpful but not all foreigners will be good
\item We should show outsiders Athens but we must be wary of spies and those that want to hurt us
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Speech 3}
\label{sec:org8868fb8}
\begin{itemize}
\item Is every person fit to govern?
\item Slaves come from enemy lands and don't have the best interest of Athens at heart
\item Athenians are superior and must be the leaders of the Assembly
\item Slaves would not make fair jurors - Slaves can't be expected to do this because they have 
an inherent bias against their masters
\item There are an extremely large amount of Metics in Athens and adding this many people to the
assembly would create chaos
\item Metics already have power in the status quo
\item Too many extra people in the assembly creates problems
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Speech 4}
\label{sec:org4db1b48}
\begin{itemize}
\item The gods place us in our corresponding wombs with purpose. As a result, the gods do not want
Metics or slaves to be Athenians and to defy this is to defy the gods
\item Sparta case study proves that we need to preserve our culture
\item Metics are only here to gain wealth - they have no blood loyalty to the city
\item Must give citizenship to women because they are blood related to the city and have the power
to do this
\item Socratics agree with the equality of women
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Speech 5}
\label{sec:org7731dc5}
\begin{itemize}
\item Metic anecdote
\item Metics are, in all senses but legally, citizens of Athens
\item Metics drive the economy of Athens, the importance of which is outlined by \textbf{\textbf{The Economist}}
\item Must thank Metics for all their hard work through citizenship and representation
\item Currently, Metics have no reason to stay in Athens - need a greater population for more power
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Speech 6}
\label{sec:org802d5c1}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sheep flock to the strongest speaker and leader in the Assembly - they don't have thoughts of 
their own which is extremely dangerous in the Assembly
\item The spartan method of education builds unity
\item Judge the youth based on whether or not they have the philosophers' spirit
\item Athena herself gave women an important education
\item Those that do not come from Athenian heritage also may not have the ability to rule 
but some may have that unique capacity
\item The best path forward is to allow anyone with the proper education to rule
\end{itemize}
\section{Session 1}
\label{sec:org3b80f6e}
\subsection{President, Anytus}
\label{sec:org8dccb06}
\begin{itemize}
\item Anytus, For reconciliation
\item Knows more than most the cruelty of the Thirty, still wants forgiveness
\item Institutions themselves are faulty, not the actions of the Thirty
\item References Plato specifically
\item We as Athenians have failed to create a proper system
\item Shouldn't waste time in the past, need to wrok towards a better future
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Crito}
\label{sec:org62892fb}
\begin{itemize}
\item Socratic method of reaching the truth requires forgetting the crimes of the Thirty and forgiving
crimes of the supporters
\item It is necessary to avoid harm and punisment to create a good state
\item Good people are just, good people do not harm, therefore a just state should not harm
\item Punishment doesn't teach right and wrong, is a short term solution
\item Sets a dangerous precedent of punishment which will eventually lead to a wholly unjust state
\item Separating and prosecuting supporters of the Thirty creates divisiveness amongst Athenians
\item Prosecution distracts from the main goal of creating a better Athens
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Lithicles}
\label{sec:org5e6a8d5}
\begin{itemize}
\item Without prosecuting the Thirty, those that died under their rule have not recieved justice
\item The Thirty changed the whole nature of Athens and Athenian culture - that can't be accepted
\item Must punish the Thirty as a symbol of our victory and sends a message to Sparta
\item How can we move forward without avenging those who were lost?
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Lycon}
\label{sec:orgc1d9066}
\begin{itemize}
\item We must continue our democracy and rule of law
\item To forgive and forget the rule of the Thirty would be to disrespect the Athenians that lost
their lives under the rule of the Thirty
\item Expected of the Socratics to support reconciliation because they supported the Thirty
\item The thirty and the Socratics must be prosectued
\item Socrates hates democracy and supported the Thirty which is wholly unacceptable
\item Dismissing the crimes of the Thirty is equivalent to surrendering
\end{itemize}

\subsection{General Arguments}
\label{sec:org8b23ea0}
\begin{itemize}
\item A closer look at the 30 tyrants and their actions
\item Modern oligarchies operate better than traditional democracies
\item A spartan model with the 30 was problematic due to the number of people in the oligarchy
\item Smaller oligarchies create more cohesion in the state
\item Even one bad oligarch can be problematic as it creates a domino effect
\end{itemize}
