\subsection{Speech 1}

\item Being a good Athenian that helps your state and is just in your actions is all that is truly
required of citizens
\item Must share the beauty of Athens unto everyone

\item Our loyalty must be firstly to the gods and to Athens, doing so requires us to bestow citizenship
upon those that deserve it
\end{itemize}

\label{sec:orgf9593d0}
\begin{itemize}
\item Metics and slaves can't be trusted to put Athens above themselves

many shops would close and our economy would decline

\item Is every person fit to govern?
\item Slaves come from enemy lands and don't have the best interest of Athens at heart

\item Slaves would not make fair jurors - Slaves can't be expected to do this because they have 
an inherent bias against their masters

assembly would create chaos
\item Metics already have power in the status quo
\item Too many extra people in the assembly creates problems
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Speech 4}
\label{sec:orgf3a45ca}
\begin{itemize}
\item The gods place us in our corresponding wombs with purpose. As a result, the gods do not want
Metics or slaves to be Athenians and to defy this is to defy the gods
\item Sparta case study proves that we need to preserve our culture
\item Metics are only here to gain wealth - they have no blood loyalty to the city
\item Must give citizenship to women because they are blood related to the city and have the power
to do this
\item Socratics agree with the equality of women
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Speech 5}
\label{sec:org16100c6}

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Speech 6}
\label{sec:org248fd14}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sheep flock to the strongest speaker and leader in the Assembly - they don't have thoughts of 
their own which is extremely dangerous in the Assembly
\item The spartan method of education builds unity
\item Judge the youth based on whether or not they have the philosophers' spirit

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Crito}
\label{sec:org17ba1bc}
\begin{itemize}
\item Socratic method of reaching the truth requires forgetting the crimes of the Thirty and forgiving
crimes of the supporters
\item It is necessary to avoid harm and punisment to create a good state
\item Good people are just, good people do not harm, therefore a just state should not harm

their lives under the rule of the Thirty
\item Expected of the Socratics to support reconciliation because they supported the Thirty
