*** Leadership Qualities
- Love of learning
- Knowledge of one's own ignorace
- Prioritizing state interests over individual ones
*** Education
- Begins with understanding the arts, gentleness, and compassion
- Followed by significant gymnastics
- Education must be rooted in individual excellence
- Not all leaders must be aristocrats, they simply need the proper education
  - How does a non-aristocrat get such an education?
- Payment for political participation is bad - one need not be incentivized for
  participation and devotion to their state
*** Citizenship
- Anyone with the necessary aptitude, including women, can become citizens
** Thrasybulans
- Injustice, while bad, indicates an unjust person rather than an unjust state
- Education need not necessitate an artistic background - a military education is far more important

** Solonians
*** Leadership Qualities
- Leaders should be well-versed and acting in the best interest of the state
- Leaders need to be well-rounded and certain people are better fit for these positions than others
- The assembly is chaotic and ineffective as a means of decision-making and ruling
*** Societal Qualities
- Forgiveness is necessary for past wrong-doings
- While wealth and education is largely cyclical, we should not be restructuring our society wholly
- Metics and Low-income individuals should not have significant voices in assembly because they
  don't have the education necessary to have a strong, educational conversation
*** Citizenship
- Only strong, wealthy individuals should have citizenship to preserve the quality of Athens
