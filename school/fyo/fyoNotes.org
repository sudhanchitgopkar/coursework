  participation and devotion to their state

- Leaders should be well-versed and acting in the best interest of the state
- Leaders need to be well-rounded and certain people are better fit for these positions than others
- The assembly is chaotic and ineffective as a means of decision-making and ruling
*** Societal Qualities
- Forgiveness is necessary for past wrong-doings
- While wealth and education is largely cyclical, we should not be restructuring our society wholly
- Metics and Low-income individuals should not have significant voices in assembly because they
  don't have the education necessary to have a strong, educational conversation
*** Citizenship
- Only strong, wealthy individuals should have citizenship to preserve the quality of Athens
