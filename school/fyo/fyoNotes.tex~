\end{itemize}
\subsection{Crito}
\label{sec:org6c61905}
\begin{itemize}
\item Socratic method of reaching the truth requires forgetting the crimes of the Thirty and forgiving
crimes of the supporters
\item It is necessary to avoid harm and punisment to create a good state
\item Good people are just, good people do not harm, therefore a just state should not harm
\item Punishment doesn't teach right and wrong, is a short term solution
\item Sets a dangerous precedent of punishment which will eventually lead to a wholly unjust state
\item Separating and prosecuting supporters of the Thirty creates divisiveness amongst Athenians
\item Prosecution distracts from the main goal of creating a better Athens
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lycon}
\label{sec:org48b83c8}

\item To forgive and forget the rule of the Thirty would be to disrespect the Athenians that lost
their lives under the rule of the Thirty
\item Expected of the Socratics to support reconciliation because they supported the Thirty
