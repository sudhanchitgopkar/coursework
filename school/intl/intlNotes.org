* Module 3
** Institutions and States
*** Institutions
- Institution: Institutions are formal and informal rules 
  that structure the relationship among individuals
- Can have legal or social forces
- Institutions are resistant to change but can change as a 
  - response to outside forces
  - response to internal pressures
  - response to effects of other institutions
*** The State
- An organization that maintains a legitimate monopoly of force over a certain territory
  and its population
- A set of political institutions sets policies for the territory and its population
- Sovereignty: The ability for a state to carry out actions/policies within a territory
  independently from external actors or internal rivals/challengers
- Issues of autonomy and capcity: 
  - Autonomy: the ability for the state to weild its power independently of the public
  - Capacity: the ability for the state to accrue and utilize sufficient resources to carry out
    basic tasks and responsibilities
*** Definitions
**** General
- State: governing structur's legitimate expression of sovereignty/main political organization 
  of a country
- Regime: Informal institutions that guide how a state operates
- Government: Collection of actors in charge of carrying out political decisions of the regime
  and in the interest of the state
- Country: More generic; refers to the political collectivity of a soverieng territory
- Nation: Refers to a group of people bound together by some trait who seek to establish 
  to establish and express political interests
- Nation != Country
**** Strength of States
- Institutional Capabilities
  - Strong States: Has good institutional foundations; these institutions function well
  - Weak States: Does not have good institutional foundations, its institutions do not function well 
  - Failed States: Institutions so weak that they basically collapse and have no sovereignty
- Organizational Structure
  - Strong states maintain a fair amonut of centralized control
  - Weak states hand down authority to local institutions and are decentralized
** Legitimacy & Sovereignty
- Legitimacy: a value whereby something or someone is recognized and accepted by a large 
  portion of the population as right and proper (is highly subjective)
- Types of legitimacy:
  - Traditional legitimacy: embodies historicla myths/legends and continues from past to present
  - Charismatic legitimacy: Built on the force of ideas and appeals embodied by a leader
  - Rational-Legal legitimacy: Based on a system of laws and procedures that are institutionalized
- Sources of Legitimacy:
  - Conferred by the ruler to a ruler, government, or state
  - Ascribed to a state or ruler by other states or rulers (prerequisity for intl. cooperation)
  - Ascribed to a state or ruler by organizations/non-state actors
- Legitimacy can often be used to push for change

** Defining a Good Society
- Although observable, empirical assessments may differ from person to person,
  depending upon factors that may distort individual observation.
- Multiple factors contribute to whether a society is "good" or not, critical to comparing countries and 
  political systems

*** "Traditional Approach"
- Focus on a "formal-legal" aspects of political institutions
- Mostly a categorizing exercise with little analysis
- Many European ex-pats were these scholars
*** Modern Era (1960s-1980s)
- Scholars stop describing, start comparing
- Behavioral Revolution - emphasis on individual, group behavior, not static institutions
- Gave rise to "developmentalism" or "modernization theory" 
  - Proposed that a state develops economically, political and social development follows
  - Functionalism (functions of differently societal elements lay foundation for growth)
*** Development (1960s-1980s)
- 5 stages each society goes through for development:
- Traditional society (no mass production)
- Preconditions for economic take-off (advent of industrialization and mass production)
- Take-off (dynamic economic growth) 
- Drive to maturity (long era of econ growth, modern tech usage)
- Age of high mass consumption (everyon is within driving distance of McDonalds (most places))
*** Critiques of Behavioralims/Developmentalism
- Enthocentric and ideologically driven
- Creates dependency: capitalism creates a situation where underdeveloped countries depend
  on developed countries
- Developmentalist theories tried to be a one-size-fit-all theory which wasn't bale to be applied
  to all individual case studies
*** Post-Behavioralism (1990s-Present)
- Development of middle-range theories instead of one single theory
- Diversity of approaches (qualitative, quantitative, case sudies)
- Takes culture and historical context into consideration
- Rational choice theory applied
- Political economy: the state can have a varying role in economic matters
*** New Institutionalism (Past 25 years)
- Institutions are the nexus of political action
- Institutions are dynamic that interact over time w other variables
- Institutions comprise the surrounding environment & sentiment

*** The Study of Comparative Politics
- Comparative politics implies a method of study or an approach to an analysis, not a single theory
- greatest challenge is that events occur in real time with unreplicable environments
- events in politics can not be replicated to test for validity
*** Goals
- Goal: To assess which factors cause a certain outcome by comparing or contrasting cases
- Cases: One of the group of things (events, states, actors, etc.) to be studied
- Variable: a factor that changes over time or in different cases
  - Independent var: causal var
  - Dependent var: outcome var
- Causal relationships can be shown as:
  - Cause -> effect
  - Independent var -> dependent var
  - Explanators var -> outcome
  - x var -> y var
- Hypothesis: a possible answer that explains a causal effect
*** Challenges
- Goal: to determine causality, not just correlation

- In comparative politics, the researcher may not be able to:
  - have a constant
  - measure certain variables
  - anticipate certain events
  - disentangle one variable from others
  - Access to cases & information
    - Langauage barriers
    - Time & funding
    - Sufficient cases (and selection bias)
    - IRB (Institutional Review Board)
- Correlation: when var A occurs with var B, one is not caused by the other
- Endogeneity: when it cannot be determined whether an outcome was caused by another factor
    or the outcome caused that factor to occur

*** Most Similar Systems Design (MSS)
- A method in which as many independent vars as possible are held constant to explain a political
  outcome: similar cases, different outcomes can help isolate a variable
- Special Variation of MSS: Within-Case Comparison
  - Single case analyzed over time or in different geographical areas
  - Breaks up a single case into subparts and allows for comparison
*** Most-Different Systems Design (MDS)
- Looks at cases that are different from one another and observes why the same political outcome is
  observed as a method of understanding how to isolate a single causal variable
*** Overview
- Probable causal explanations (hypotheses): goal of these comparative approaches
- Theories can be built from the strongest hypothesis
- Theories can further be generalized based on the case
