\section{Module 10}
\label{sec:org712d8be}
\subsection{Developing Countries}
\label{sec:org80bd050}
\begin{itemize}
\item Economic Development
\begin{itemize}
\item Economic development can be indicated by GDP and GDP per capita
\item GDP/Capita doesn't account for income inequality, which is accounted for by the Gini Index
\end{itemize}
\item Sub-national Variations
\begin{itemize}
\item Components of Index:
\begin{itemize}
\item Life expectancy at birth
\item Expected years of schooling
\item GNI (Gross National Income) per capita
\end{itemize}
\item Looking at national indeces is not as specific or accurate, many times
\end{itemize}
\item First, Second, Third World
\begin{itemize}
\item Used during the cold war but no longer used by political scientists
\item West = first world
\item Second world = communist
\item Third world = everyone else
\end{itemize}
\item Middle and Lower Income Country
\begin{itemize}
\item Middle-Income Country: Historically less-developed country that experienced significant economic growth and democratization
\item Lower-Income Country: A country that lacks significant economic development or political institutionalization, or both
\item Not static definitions, imply a path along which a country is moving
\end{itemize}
\item Roots of Middle \& Lower Income Countrues
\begin{itemize}
\item Imperialism: projecting power outside the state in order to gain resources
\item Colonialism: A greater degree of physical occupation by the imperial power (not just a skeleton crew in charge of shipping good back home)
\end{itemize}
\item Historical Roots of Middle and Lower Income Countries
\begin{itemize}
\item Spain \& Portugal: Central/South America
\item Britain \& France: North America
\item Japan: Chunks of Asia
\item Various European Powers: N Afrrica -> Most of Africa -> Middle East -> Asia
\end{itemize}
\item What Imperialism Meant:
\begin{itemize}
\item Imposition of imperial power's institutions obliterating original institutions
\item Borders reflected imperial country's strategic interests, not geographic or demographic realities
\item Imperial power's state was trying to ``civilize'' or ``modernize'' territory
\item Bureaucratic structures established by imperial powers (National language, legal code, administrative capacities)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Developing Countries (cont.)}
\label{sec:org43d69be}
\subsubsection{Imperialism \& Culture}
\label{sec:org4e6fb5d}
\begin{itemize}
\item Identity shift: before imperialism, people held identities based on clans, religion, econ status, gender, etc. The imperial powers constructed and imposed new national/ethnic identities for conquered territories based on ascribed racial characteristics. These identities were used for classification and admin purposes, distribution of resources to indigenous populations
\item Religion transplant
\begin{itemize}
\item Catholocism in Latin America
\item Islam in North Africa, Mediterranean
\item Protestantism in North America
\end{itemize}
\item Gender roles transplanted as well, diminished status of women and took out matriarchies
\item Legacies of imperialism: Belgium -> Hutus \& Tutsis -> Rwandan Genocide
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Imperialism \& Culture}
\label{sec:orgd49635d}
\begin{itemize}
\item Production \& Dependence
\begin{itemize}
\item Traditional socieities turned into cash socieities, stemming from th resource needs of imperial powers
\item Significant mercantilist economies
\item Massive companies acted as states in territories (Dutch East India Company
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Development in the Modern Era}
\label{sec:org4a65496}
\begin{itemize}
\item Third wave of democratization
\item Colonies gained independence in the 1960s under harsh conditions to take full autonomy over
\end{itemize}
\section{10.09.20}
\label{sec:org02939e0}
Donald Trump, during his time as president of the United States has upheld American democracy by abiding by the systems of checks and balances in the branches of government and actively contributing to passing policy that he promised during the 2016 election cycle. Democracies are based largely upon governments following the will of the people and the argument can be made that when Donald Trump was elected in 2016, the people wanted the policies he promised.
\section{Module 8}
\label{sec:org97d2493}
\subsection{Developed Democracies}
\label{sec:org1a7fec3}

\item Post-modern or post-material values: values things more than just the ability to live
from day to day; Increasing quality of life through high mass consumption and self-
acutalization
\item Began and most prevalent in Europe, least prevalent in Africa w NA,SA in between
\item Economic development often supports democratic development but does not always relate
\item Human Development Index shows that just because a country is rich doesn't mean wealth
is evenly distributed
\item Gini Index can be used to show inequality, Social democracies have low gini scores
\begin{itemize}
\item US is an anomaly here
\item COVID shows that death rate is extremely low for mercantile democracy
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Judiciary}
\label{sec:orgde79882}
\begin{itemize}
\item Central to democracy's rule of law
\item Different types of courts and organizations of courts

Limited government (Separation of powers) & High policy-making efficiency\\
Checks and Balances -> Gridlock & Fusion of divisions != Gridlock\\
Popularly-elected executive & Executive: leader of largest party\\
Fixed terms, no long term grip & Parties can hold power for long times\\
Elections are candidate-based & Single party loyalty (?)\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\subsection{Electoral Systems}
\label{sec:org09122c0}
\subsubsection{Single-member District (SMD)}
\label{sec:org1fd211b}
\begin{itemize}
\item Also called the ``first past the post'' or ``winner take all'' system
\item Voting for candidates directly instead of for a party
\item Most likely to result in a two-party system
\begin{itemize}
\item Called Duverge's Law
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Proportional Representation (PR)}
\label{sec:org0fd038a}
\begin{itemize}
\item Made of multi-member districts (mmd) - more than 1 person elected from ea. electoral district
\item People vote for parties moreso than individuals
\item Votes are ranked for parties
\item Proportion of the vote for a particular party wins the party certain amounts of seats
\item Tends to result in multiple parties winning seats, generally leading to electoral thresholds
\end{itemize}

\item Initiatives are political decisions put to the people due to a petition
\item Certain number of people need to sign a petition before a vote
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item by levying import tariffs/duties
\item through imposition of quotas
\item by providing subsidies to its own domestic firms
\item by introducing other non-tariff barriers
\end{itemize}
\item Trade that is free from barriers is theorized to improve economic development/innovaiton
through the use of a comparative advantage
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Varieties of Capitalism}
\label{sec:org4d7a32a}
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\item Mercantile Democracy: State controls economy
\begin{itemize}
\item State owns parts or all of industry
\item Heavy regulations, tariffs, and non-tariff barriers to foster and protect domestic industry
\item Little social expenditure, low taxes
\item Allows for rapid economic growth (Asian TIGER countries) and often export oriented
\end{itemize}
\item No single type of democracy is better than another- some simply align with certain interests
\end{itemize}
\section{Module 4}
\label{sec:orgcc41563}
\subsection{Nations \& Society}
\label{sec:org40fb8cc}
\begin{itemize}
\item Goals of nation-building:
\begin{itemize}
\item Capacity
\item Legitimacy
\item Identity
\end{itemize}
\item Society: ``A collection of people bound by shared institutions that define how relations
should be conducted
\item Types of Identity:
\begin{itemize}
\item Primordial (genetic)
\item Ascribed (given by others)
\item Socially constructed (develops over time)
\end{itemize}
\item Identity is not inherently political but can be politicized
\item Citizenship: An individual or group's relation to the state
\item Different states have different citizenship regimes
\begin{itemize}
\item Allowance of dual citizenship
\item Types of naturalization process
\end{itemize}
\item Identity as an Institution
\begin{itemize}
\item Identities comprise kinds of institutions
\item Identites are sticky

\end{itemize}
\item Ethnic conflict: Conflict between ethnic groups that struggle to acheive goals
at each other's expense
\item National Conflict: Conflict in which one or more groups within a country 
develops clear aspirations for political independence, clashing with others as a result
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Political Culture \& Ideology}
\label{sec:org38ecc64}

\item Political culture is very difficult to define and is relative
\begin{itemize}
\item can be considered an informal institution
\item may be rooted in culture or religion
\item developed from an early age
\end{itemize}
\item Political attitudes: how one sees the operations of the state and its institutions
\begin{itemize}
\item Radical, liberal, conservative, reactionary
\item Majority are around center
\item Liberal: Seek to change society through institutional adjustments
\item Constitution: Prefer continuity, resist change
\item Radicals and Reactionaries: generally outside instuitutions, may use violence
\end{itemize}

\item A liberal in the US = a conservative in France
\end{itemize}
\item Political ideologies: what one views as the fundamental goals of politics
\begin{itemize}
\item Communism -> Social Democracy -> Liberalism -> Fascism -> Anarchy
\item Here, liberalism supports political choice, not political attitudes
\item Social democracy supports greater state intervention

\label{sec:org41bfb3a}
\begin{itemize}
\item Europe v the New World
\begin{itemize}
\item Compare the state development of European, ``old-world'' countries and ``new world'' countries``
\begin{itemize}
\item Old world countries tend to be more imperialistic while new countries have a common exp
of being colonies
\item New world countries were composed of different types of people while 
Old world countries had a shared history
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Feudalism: Geographic proximity and increasing power of feudal lords -> challenges between 
feudal properties were likely, so organization of resources and capabilities was key to survival
\item Feudalism led to increased collectivism, translating to:
\begin{itemize}
\item large, active labor organizations
\item large, state-provided social welfare
\item emphasis on production of higher quality goods instead of new innovation
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\section{Module 3}
\label{sec:org28695bc}
\subsection{Institutions and States}
\label{sec:org3a20412}

\label{sec:org456e29c}
\begin{itemize}
\item Institution: Institutions are formal and informal rules 
that structure the relationship among individuals
\item Can have legal or social forces
\item Institutions are resistant to change but can change as a 
\begin{itemize}
\item response to outside forces

\item response to effects of other institutions
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{The State}
\label{sec:orge08baf2}
\begin{itemize}
\item An organization that maintains a legitimate monopoly of force over a certain territory
and its population
\item A set of political institutions sets policies for the territory and its population

of a country
\item Regime: Informal institutions that guide how a state operates
\item Government: Collection of actors in charge of carrying out political decisions of the regime
and in the interest of the state
\item Country: More generic; refers to the political collectivity of a soverieng territory
\item Nation: Refers to a group of people bound together by some trait who seek to establish 
to establish and express political interests
\item Nation != Country
\end{itemize}
\item Strength of States
\label{sec:org66fbc14}
\begin{itemize}
\item Institutional Capabilities
\begin{itemize}
\item Strong States: Has good institutional foundations; these institutions function well
\item Weak States: Does not have good institutional foundations, its institutions do not function well
\item Failed States: Institutions so weak that they basically collapse and have no sovereignty
\end{itemize}
\item Organizational Structure
\begin{itemize}
\item Strong states maintain a fair amonut of centralized control
\item Weak states hand down authority to local institutions and are decentralized
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Legitimacy \& Sovereignty}
\label{sec:org59ee7db}
\begin{itemize}
\item Legitimacy: a value whereby something or someone is recognized and accepted by a large 
portion of the population as right and proper (is highly subjective)
\item Types of legitimacy:
\begin{itemize}
\item Traditional legitimacy: embodies historical myths/legends and continues from past to present
\item Charismatic legitimacy: Built on the force of ideas and appeals embodied by a leader
\item Rational-Legal legitimacy: Based on a system of laws and procedures that are institutionalized
\end{itemize}
\item Sources of Legitimacy:
\begin{itemize}
\item Conferred by the ruler to a ruler, government, or state
\item Ascribed to a state or ruler by other states or rulers (prerequisity for intl. cooperation)
\item Ascribed to a state or ruler by organizations/non-state actors
\end{itemize}
\item Legitimacy can often be used to push for change
\end{itemize}
\section{08.26.20}
\label{sec:orgf76afee}
\subsection{Defining a Good Society}
\label{sec:org7f7708b}
\begin{itemize}
\item Although observable, empirical assessments may differ from person to person,
depending upon factors that may distort individual observation.
\item Multiple factors contribute to whether a society is ``good'' or not, critical to comparing countries and 
political systems
\end{itemize}
\section{Module 2}
\label{sec:orgee088ad}
\subsection{Video 1}
\label{sec:orgf540834}
\subsubsection{``Traditional Approach''}
\label{sec:org1388efd}
\begin{itemize}
\item Focus on a ``formal-legal'' aspects of political institutions
\item Mostly a categorizing exercise with little analysis
\item Many European ex-pats were these scholars
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Modern Era (1960s-1980s)}
\label{sec:orgd0d3581}
\begin{itemize}
\item Scholars stop describing, start comparing
\item Behavioral Revolution - emphasis on individual, group behavior, not static institutions
\item Gave rise to ``developmentalism'' or ``modernization theory'' 
\begin{itemize}
\item Proposed that a state develops economically, political and social development follows
\item Functionalism (functions of differently societal elements lay foundation for growth)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Development (1960s-1980s)}
\label{sec:org6e6e5b7}
\begin{itemize}
\item 5 stages each society goes through for development:
\item Traditional society (no mass production)
\item Preconditions for economic take-off (advent of industrialization and mass production)
\item Take-off (dynamic economic growth)
\item Drive to maturity (long era of econ growth, modern tech usage)
\item Age of high mass consumption (everyon is within driving distance of McDonalds (most places))
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Critiques of Behavioralims/Developmentalism}
\label{sec:org8bb556c}
\begin{itemize}
\item Enthocentric and ideologically driven
\item Creates dependency: capitalism creates a situation where underdeveloped countries depend
on developed countries
\item Developmentalist theories tried to be a one-size-fit-all theory which wasn't bale to be applied
to all individual case studies
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Post-Behavioralism (1990s-Present)}
\label{sec:orga68a24a}
\begin{itemize}
\item Development of middle-range theories instead of one single theory
\item Diversity of approaches (qualitative, quantitative, case sudies)
\item Takes culture and historical context into consideration
\item Rational choice theory applied
\item Political economy: the state can have a varying role in economic matters
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{New Institutionalism (Past 25 years)}
\label{sec:orgbababd4}
\begin{itemize}
\item Institutions are the nexus of political action
\item Institutions are dynamic that interact over time w other variables
\item Institutions comprise the surrounding environment \& sentiment
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Video 2}
\label{sec:org0fe9097}
\subsubsection{The Study of Comparative Politics}
\label{sec:org7d88a68}
\begin{itemize}
\item Comparative politics implies a method of study or an approach to an analysis, not a single theory
\item greatest challenge is that events occur in real time with unreplicable environments
\item events in politics can not be replicated to test for validity
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Goals}
\label{sec:orgc6fc9e2}
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal: To assess which factors cause a certain outcome by comparing or contrasting cases
\item Cases: One of the group of things (events, states, actors, etc.) to be studied
\item Variable: a factor that changes over time or in different cases
\begin{itemize}
\item Independent var: causal var
\item Dependent var: outcome var
\end{itemize}
\item Causal relationships can be shown as:
\begin{itemize}
\item Cause -> effect
\item Independent var -> dependent var
\item Explanators var -> outcome
\item x var -> y var
\end{itemize}
\item Hypothesis: a possible answer that explains a causal effect
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Challenges}
\label{sec:orgd9407aa}
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal: to determine causality, not just correlation

\item In comparative politics, the researcher may not be able to:
\begin{itemize}
\item have a constant
\item measure certain variables
\item anticipate certain events
\item disentangle one variable from others
\item Access to cases \& information
\begin{itemize}
\item Langauage barriers
\item Time \& funding
\item Sufficient cases (and selection bias)
\item IRB (Institutional Review Board)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Correlation: when var A occurs with var B, one is not caused by the other
\item Endogeneity: when it cannot be determined whether an outcome was caused by another factor
or the outcome caused that factor to occur
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Video 3}
\label{sec:org8b988a6}
\subsubsection{Most Similar Systems Design (MSS)}
\label{sec:org2d63dfc}
\begin{itemize}
\item A method in which as many independent vars as possible are held constant to explain a political
outcome: similar cases, different outcomes can help isolate a variable
\item Special Variation of MSS: Within-Case Comparison
\begin{itemize}
\item Single case analyzed over time or in different geographical areas
\item Breaks up a single case into subparts and allows for comparison
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Most-Different Systems Design (MDS)}
\label{sec:orga788e65}
\begin{itemize}
\item Looks at cases that are different from one another and observes why the same political outcome is
observed as a method of understanding how to isolate a single causal variable
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Overview}
\label{sec:orgab11860}
\begin{itemize}
\item Probable causal explanations (hypotheses): goal of these comparative approaches
\item Theories can be built from the strongest hypothesis
\item Theories can further be generalized based on the case
\end{itemize}
\end{document}
