1.1 Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - Since 1951, UN Refugee Convention defines refugees as "persons
    fleeing racial, ethnonational, religious, or political persecution
    in their state of origin."
  - Existing international law does not acknowledge climate refugees


1.2 UN Context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.2.1 Concert of Europe
-----------------------

  - After the fall of France in 1815, European powers form a
    multilateral forum, known as the Concert of Europe
  - Was effective because of Britain and its insurance of peace by
    balancing alliances using its strong navy
  - ended with the imperial drive towards Africa


1.2.2 Functionalism & Technocrats
---------------------------------

  - Industrial revolution led to increased international cooperation
    among technical expers (Technocrats)
  - Cooperation led to the standardization of many important things
    including railroad track width, shipping protocols, and signs
  - This is generally referred to as functionalism


1.2.3 League of Nations
-----------------------

  - League of Nations was drafted during WWI and created after the war
    as a way of maintaining some sort of international forum.
  - Created significant tension with Germany because of the war guilt
    clause and the effect it had on Germany's international standing
  - Americans didn't like the LoN and ultimately didn't join it, leading
    to the ineffectiveness of the body


1.2.4 The UN
------------

  - UN created at the end of WWII to promote peace and international
    security
  - Like the LoN, was founded by the victors of war and excluded Axis
    powers


1.3 Situation Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - Religious Persecution - Persecution is widespread and perhaps the
    oldest form of persecution.
  - Political eprsecution - increased in the modern era due to conflict
    of political ideologies
    - Eg. opponents to communism after the Russian Revolution, Spanish
      loyalists, Cuban and Hatian refugees in the US post-WWII
  - LoN achieves first steps to granting protection to political
    refugees and asylum
  - Refugee convention
    - Standardized policies on refugees critical after WWII and the
      holocaust, which caused the displacement of a significant amount
      of jews. Eventually led to the Refugee Convention of 1951


2 Mod 1 (Survey)
================

  - I would define a refugee as any person with a demonstrated need to
    relocate from their original place of residence due to hazardous,
    life-threatening conditions
  - Someone may need to flee from an area impacted by the effects of
    climate change for a variety of reasons. Firstly, climate change has
    significant, documented effects on crop productivity and cultivation
    potential. Accordingly, severe effects of climate change may prevent
    food and water from being accessible to a location where it once
    was. Furthermore, extreme weather events occur disproportionately
    more in areas that are significantly affected by climate change,
    leading to hazardous living conditions for people in the area.
  - I believe that a country is no more obligated to allow climate
    refugees to obtain asylum than refugees fleeing political,
    religious, or racial persecution. That being said, I do think that
    countries have a moral obligation to provide any assistance possible
    to refugees, including asylum, when doing so does not significantly
    hurt their citizens.
