<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge2da1d2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>HumInt = Human intelligence
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One of the oldest methods of collecting intelligence</li>
<li>Includes overt and clandestine activities</li>
<li>Can include diplomats, officials, hearings, etc.</li>
<li>Can provide key insights that technical collection can not</li>
<li>Can also provide documentary information</li>
<li>Most cost-effective</li>
<li>Three levels:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Target-Specific: Closely managed, deep access, best ROI</li>
<li>Research-enabled: Lead-generated, environmental-monitoring with generalized searching with minimal investment and trying to focus collection</li>
<li>Opportunistic: Others come to you with specific information, low-hanging fruit</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>SigInt = Signals Intelligence
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Includes ComInt (communications), ElInt (Electronic Signals) FisInt (Foreign Instumentation Signals), TelInt (Telemetry)</li>
<li>ComInt is general broadcasting, ElInt is understanding non-explicit communications (radar), FisInt looks at different command and tool signals to estimate power/type of opponents tools</li>
</ul></li>
<li>ImInt = Imagery Intelligence and analysis of imagery that comes from film, infrared, digital information
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ImInt provides geolocation, activity detection, facility analysis, area mapping</li>
<li>Disadvantages: Image quality generally degraded by darkness, weather, enemies that know ImInt is being used against them can fake information, requires tech-focused analysts</li>
</ul></li>
<li>MasInt = Measurements and Signatures Intelligence

<li>GeoInt = Geospatial Imagery Information
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Focuses on depicting physical characteristics of geographical areas</li>
</ul></li>
<li>TechInt = Technical Intelligence
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Focuses on weapons systems</li>
<li>Critical to covert operations</li>
</ul></li>
<li>OSInt = Open Source Intelligence
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Use of materials available to the public</li>
<li>Generally use public databases</li>
<li>Problematic because journals often focus on theoreticals</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Cycle is over-simplified, doesn&rsquo;t account for specific types of intelligence collection or specifics of what policy-makers may want</li>

<div id="outline-container-orgd6ece79" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd6ece79">Additional Steps</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd6ece79">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Some argue that consumption should be included in the cycle. Disemmination is not the end of the cycle, the way in which information is consumed should be considered because of the effects that has on decision-making</li>
<li>Feedback may also be important to consider because of a continuous loop of feedback during and after the process is beind completed</li>
<li>Counter-intelligence and covert action not addressed by this cycle, which gives an incorrect understanding of contemporary intelligence operations</li>

<h3 id="org9836f23">Introduction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9836f23">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Intelligence is defined as a set of activities carried out by government agencies that operate largely in secret including collection and interpretation of information from a mixture of open and clandestine sources to arrive at a product useful to illuminate foreign policy deliberations</li>

<h3 id="org7339737">Planning and Direction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7339737">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>intel managers and policy officials must decide what data should be gathered</li>
<li>determine what the most critical information to policy-making is</li>
<li>scope = breadth of intelligence tasks</li>
<li>paradoxically, more wealthy nations are more likely to have information failures</li>
<li>The more affluent and globally oriented a nation, the larger its agenda of intelligence objectives and its institutional apparatus for espionage, and the more
likely its chances for a large number of successes as a result of this saturated
world coverage. For the same reason, they are more likely to experience international failures as they have very large global objectives.</li>
<li>As policymakers focus their informational needs and objectives, the chances of relevant intelligence successes increases</li>

<div id="outline-container-orgffef848" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgffef848">Distinguishing Norms</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgffef848">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Institutional Survival - all intelligence agencies are bureaucracies trying to maximize resources and funding in the political marketplace</li>
<li>Secrecy - conflicts with American belief in the transparency of government, is foundational to the USIC, has lef to abuse and problems</li>
<li>Exceptionalism - occurs because of (1) secrecy, (2) breaking other country&rsquo;s laws, (3) subject to deception and disinformation, and (4) intelligence is fungible and can be used by politicians for a wide variety of purposes</li>
<li>Ambiguous Mandate - Mission has always been vague to fudge priorities and targets</li>
<li>Confederal Structure - While americans oppose a strong central intelligence authority, fragmentation</li>
<li>Competitive Intelligence - each bureau tries to compete with the other to increase innovation, eventually just ends up in redundancy and waste</li>
<li>Flexible Accountability - Many systems are rooted in accountability but intelligence seems to often get a free pass on many missions</li>
<li>Intelligence-Law Enforcement Separation - exists due to fear of combination and overpower (eg. Gestapo) and that intelligence is considered inherently different than law enforcement</li>
<li>Separation of Intelligence from Policy - Many argue that for intelligence to be truly objective, it must be separated from policy.  Some argue that intelligence works best when it is in tuen with a policy-makers objectives</li>
<li>Policy Support - due to the separation, intelligence is an area of the government. There is disagreement about how much intelligence should be used to support or advocate for a policy</li>
<li>&ldquo;Can Do&rdquo; Attitude - optimism and risk-taking inherent to intelligence efforts</li>
<li>Primacy of analysis - US has very significant amount of analysis capabilities, especially because of the role of intelligence on policy and decision-making in government</li>
<li>&ldquo;Accurate, timely, and relevant intelligence&rdquo; - phrase has become a mantra within USIC and shows main principles of intelligence work</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org57dd987" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org57dd987">Road to Failure</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org57dd987">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Norms of USIC indicate uncertainty about the role of intelligence in government and society</li>
<li>US Intelligence is the product of political compromise and checks and balances, with certain positive qualities giving intelligence workers the tools necessary to do their job</li>
<li>Many good and bad aspects to intelligence</li>
<li>As a whole, intelligence identity of the US reflects the fact that people want intel to serve the national interest, but abide by the conutry&rsquo;s democratic princples - which eventually helps conduct important work but also sets up the intel community for failure in some cases.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>National Security Act of 1947 defines foreign intelligence as &ldquo;information relating to the capabilities, intentions, or activities of foreign governments or elements thereof.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Hoover Commission 1955 define that &ldquo;intelligence deals with all the things which should be jnown in advance of initiating a course of action&rdquo;</li>
<li>Brown-Aspin Commission defines that intelligence is &ldquo;simply and boradly information about things foreign - people, places, things, and events - needed by the government for the conduct of its functions&rdquo;</li>
<li>Joint Chief if Staffs Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms defines it as &ldquo;the product resulting from the collection, processing, integration, analysis, evaluation, and interpretation of available information concerning foreign countries or areas&rdquo; or as &ldquo;information and knowledge about an adversary obtained through observation, investigation, analysis, or understanding&rdquo;</li>
