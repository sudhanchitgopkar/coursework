\section{01.15.21}
\label{sec:org86455a5}
\begin{itemize}
\item Brain has a complex set of structures that work together to do both really important, and fundamentally flawed actions
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Brain Stem}
\label{sec:orga7782a1}
\begin{itemize}
\item The reptilian brain
\item Really just an extensino of the spinal cord
\item Controls automatic actions, no effect on decision-making
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Middle Brain (Limbic System)}
\label{sec:orga11f550}
\begin{itemize}
\item Body's monitoring system to identify important elements of the environment
\item Discriminates things of importantance constantly and ambiently
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Brain Cortex}
\label{sec:orge1b9fe8}
\begin{itemize}
\item Controls higher-level thinking
\item Moral decision-making, learning, conscious awareness
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Hierarchy of the brain}
\label{sec:orgcb7673c}
\begin{itemize}
\item Information goes from the brain stem, to the limbic system, to the brain cortex
\item Critically, the limbic system was never designed to collect all the information around you - that incomplete information is used for decision-making
\item Understanding the interplay and potential biases of the limbic system can help us understand decision-making and prevent bad decision making
\item Fear and the triggering of fear prevents higher-level decision making and can prevent the intake of new information
\item Sources of information can also have a significant effect on the processing of that information - can be seen through in-group/out-group bias
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Rational Decision-Making}
\label{sec:org4ab04d8}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Pick a goal
\item Evaluate all strategies
\begin{itemize}
\item Analyze costs
\item Analyze benefits
\end{itemize}
\item Select strategy with best cost/benefit ratio
\item Bias often occurs at stage 2 because of filtration of information through the limbic system
\end{enumerate}
