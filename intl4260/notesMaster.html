<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7ff5419">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is critical for our leaders to be aware of:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How they frame issues as they make decisions</li>
<li>How they frame issues when they talk to us</li>
<li>The frame our adversaries use when we are in conflict with them</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Loss-framing is a critical part of negative campaigining</li>
<li>Democratic institutions create multiple frames, which is not necessarily the case in non-democratic regimes</li>
<li>In non-democratic regimes, leaders and the public may settle into a frame (generally loss framing), which leads them to make riskier decisions</li>
<li>One significant benefit of democratic systems is that they are less likely to settle into a particular frame, which may be bad</li>

<h3 id="org5eae5bf">Prospect Theory</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5eae5bf">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When we frame outcomes in terms of gains, we tend to be risk-averse, even when the gambles are objectively better</li>
<li>When we frame outcomes in terms of losses, we tend to be risk-acceptant in order to avoid larger losses, even when the gambles are objectively worse for us</li>
<li>This can often be seen in stock market crashes and stock behavior, wherein people sell during a stock downturn when the rational decision is to hold on to the stock
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This can further be seen with (1) Carter and the Iranian Hostage Crisis, (2) The 2016 election of Trump, the 2020 election of Biden</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To remove yourself from a frame (regardless of whether it is risk-averse or risk-acceptant), it is critical to consider both benefits and losses</li>
<li>Risk aversion and prospect theory is applicable in multiple scenarios:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Leaders, themselves, have risk-aversive tendencies and follow prospect theories in their decision-making</li>
<li>The public can constrain the win-set of the leaders through their risk-aversive tendencies and tendency to follow prospect theory</li>
<li>Leaders can change the public&rsquo;s perspective on a topic through framing it in a different way and playing on prospect theory and loss aversion</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga03b257">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Because of loss aversion, anything given up in a negotiation has an inflated value.</li>
<li>Because this is true for both sides of a negotiation, there is a permanent hurdle to achieving a negotiated settlement</li>
<li>Also known as the endowment effect</li>
<li>concession aversion and loss aversion is stronger when bad behavior has started
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is harder to stop behavior that has already been started than it is to pre-empt bad behavior</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Due to loss aversion, states often double down on their failed policies and don&rsquo;t correct course</li>
<li><p>
Empirically, great powers always decline and hasten that decline by trying to hold fast to their previous status
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Great powers can either try harder to hold on to their power and influence</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Consider a simple dilemma, wherein an actor chooses whether to play a game.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A fair coin is flipped</li>
<li>If the coin is heads, the actor recieves $125</li>
<li>If the coin is tails, the actor loses $125</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This dilemma has an EV of (0.5 * 125) + (0.5 * -125) = 0</li>
<li>Despite an EV of 0, the vast majority of people would not play this game</li>
<li>This is a result of loss aversion, people cognitively weigh losses and harms more than they would weigh wins and benefits</li>
<li>When compared to gains, equivalent losses hurt more</li>
<li>Pain and loss aversion is a more intense feeling than gain seeking</li>
<li>This pehnomenon is consistent across regions and cultures</li>
<li>To take advantage of this, framing each decision as loss aversion (loss framing) instead of gain seeking makes it more likely to be accepted</li>
<li>Under time pressure, individuals will be more resolved to avoid losses</li>

<li>There is no significant domestic political constraint on nuclear weapon usage</li>

<li>In reality, process is not always linear - generally happens multiple times in multiple stages at multiple levels</li>

<li>People are rational and consider the risks but fight anyway (Rationalist explanation)</li>

<li>Flaws with contemporary rationalist arguments are that they don&rsquo;t address prewar bargains</li>
<li>Contemporary Rationalist reasons for war:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Anarchy</li>
<li>Benefits o/w costs</li>
<li>Rational preventitive war</li>
<li>Rational miscalculation due to lack of info</li>
<li>Rational miscalculation due to diagreement about relative power</li>

<li>Fearon&rsquo;s reasons for war
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>private or misrepresented info about relative capabilities</li>
<li>relationships are not possible because at least one party has an incentive to cheat</li>

<ul class="org-ul">

<h3 id="org587d82a">War &amp; Commitment Problems</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org587d82a">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>With anarchy, states become suspicious of one another and build weapons and engage in attacks</li>
<li>Anarchy matters when it seems as if a states preferences and opportunities for action imply that one or both sides in a dispute have incentives to renege on peaceful bargains which would be mutually preferable to war</li>
<li>Preemptive war is one such case where if one wants to go to war, doing so stealthily would be the most save. While both parties would prefer to live in peace, they are constantly afraid of doing so because of the anarchic state of internaitonal affairs
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Seems to work similar to the prisoner&rsquo;s dilemm</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The same principle can be applied to preventive war, lack of trust is not the driving factor behind war in these instances. Rather, circumstances that give one party an incentive to renege are</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Because fighting is costly and risky, rational actors should prefer negotiations to war</li>
