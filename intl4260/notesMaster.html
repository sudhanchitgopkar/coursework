<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Because of loss aversion, anything given up in a negotiation has an inflated value.</li>
<li>Because this is true for both sides of a negotiation, there is a permanent hurdle to achieving a negotiated settlement</li>
<li>Also known as the endowment effect</li>
<li>concession aversion and loss aversion is stronger when bad behavior has started
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is harder to stop behavior that has already been started than it is to pre-empt bad behavior</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Due to loss aversion, states often double down on their failed policies and don&rsquo;t correct course</li>
<li><p>
Empirically, great powers always decline and hasten that decline by trying to hold fast to their previous status
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Great powers can either try harder to hold on to their power and influence</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4a915e8">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Consider a simple dilemma, wherein an actor chooses whether to play a game.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A fair coin is flipped</li>
<li>If the coin is heads, the actor recieves $125</li>
<li>If the coin is tails, the actor loses $125</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This dilemma has an EV of (0.5 * 125) + (0.5 * -125) = 0</li>
<li>Despite an EV of 0, the vast majority of people would not play this game</li>
<li>This is a result of loss aversion, people cognitively weigh losses and harms more than they would weigh wins and benefits</li>
<li>When compared to gains, equivalent losses hurt more</li>
<li>Pain and loss aversion is a more intense feeling than gain seeking</li>
<li>This pehnomenon is consistent across regions and cultures</li>
<li>To take advantage of this, framing each decision as loss aversion (loss framing) instead of gain seeking makes it more likely to be accepted</li>
<li>Under time pressure, individuals will be more resolved to avoid losses</li>

<li>In reality, process is not always linear - generally happens multiple times in multiple stages at multiple levels</li>
<li>Larger win-sets make Level 1 agreement more likely</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Three reasons war may occur
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>People are sometimes irrational and don&rsquo;t consider the costs of war due to this irrationality or their biases</li>
<li>Leaders may enjoy benefits of war but not pay the costs</li>
<li>People are rational and consider the risks but fight anyway (Rationalist explanation)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Flaws with contemporary rationalist arguments are that they don&rsquo;t address prewar bargains</li>
<li>Contemporary Rationalist reasons for war:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Anarchy</li>
<li>Benefits o/w costs</li>
<li>Rational preventitive war</li>
<li>Rational miscalculation due to lack of info</li>
<li>Rational miscalculation due to diagreement about relative power</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fearon&rsquo;s reasons for war
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>private or misrepresented info about relative capabilities</li>
<li>relationships are not possible because at least one party has an incentive to cheat</li>
<li>Despite being able to compromise, one or more party does not want to because of their beliefs on the issue</li>

<h3 id="org3b3987c">The Puzzle</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3b3987c">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>People often see war as something nobody wants though wars can often simply be costly but worthwhile gambles</li>
<li>Wars are always ex post inefficient because no matter how small, the costs of fighting still exist</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="orgbd163b8">Anarchy</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbd163b8">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>War occurs because there is nothing to prevent it</li>
<li>Does not explain why wars still occur due to their inefficiency, therefore does not explain war completely</li>
<li>Anarchy may lead to arms races and insecurity, but little war outside or preemptive war</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0b49c6a">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If a declining power suspects that it may be attacked in the future by a rising power, it will find a preventive war rational</li>

<h3 id="orgd776934">Positive Expected Utility</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd776934">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Argues that war is rational when both sides have a positive expected utility from it</li>
<li>While often presented, this argument doesn&rsquo;t explain specific condition in which both parties fighting a war have positive expected utility</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="org0da83c1">Utility and Rationality</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0da83c1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Positive expected utility alone is not enough to provide a rationalist explanatino for war</li>
<li>Indivisibility of factors of war can also be a rational explanation of war</li>

<h3 id="org78070fc">War and Private information</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org78070fc">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>War is often the product of rational miscalculation</li>
<li>Leaders overestimate their chance of military victory</li>
<li>State lack information about other side&rsquo;s willingness to fight</li>
<li>Truly rational agents will make the same prediction about the outcome of an uncertain event when given the same set of facts
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This does not happen when miscalculation occurs, which leads to war</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There also exist incentives to misrepresent in bargaining</li>
<li>Combination of private info about relative power or will to fight and strategic incentive to misrepresent positions in baragaining constitute a rational explanation of war</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orge824bd7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge824bd7">War &amp; Commitment Problems</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge824bd7">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>With anarchy, states become suspicious of one another and build weapons and engage in attacks</li>
<li>Anarchy matters when it seems as if a states preferences and opportunities for action imply that one or both sides in a dispute have incentives to renege on peaceful bargains which would be mutually preferable to war</li>
<li>Preemptive war is one such case where if one wants to go to war, doing so stealthily would be the most save. While both parties would prefer to live in peace, they are constantly afraid of doing so because of the anarchic state of internaitonal affairs
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Seems to work similar to the prisoner&rsquo;s dilemm</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The same principle can be applied to preventive war, lack of trust is not the driving factor behind war in these instances. Rather, circumstances that give one party an incentive to renege are</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-orgf49d1c1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf49d1c1">Conclusion</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf49d1c1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Because fighting is costly and risky, rational actors should prefer negotiations to war</li>
<li>Rational actors may be unable to agree on these negotiations because
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>private information about resolve and capability, and the incentives that exist to misrepresent these</li>
<li>inability to commit to hold ip a deal</li>
