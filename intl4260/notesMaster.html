<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Integration of women into the economy and greater gender balance correlates with less conflict within countries. This seems to be correlation, not causation.</li>
<li>Explaining theories:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As women gain more positions of power, the state will become more conflict averse or more passive because women may be biologically less prone to violent conflict
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This does not consider the history of the state. Regardless of their gender, people will still be affected by the empirical decisions their state has made when considering future decisions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As diversity increases, there will be more dicsussion regarding what constitutes a national security threat and the necessary actions needed to stop such threats.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Consider comparing the same state over time with respect to gender balance. Removes a significant amount of confounding variables with cross-country comparison.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Same finding holds: as gender balance increases, a state will be less prone to conflict</li>
<li>Critically, women must be politically relevant for the above finding to hold. States that have good gender balance with little political relevance placed on women seem to operate as states that have little gender balance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Along with decreased conflict behavior, defense spending also decreases when gender balance increases (maintaining political relevance for women)</li>

<li>This can be applied to foreign policy - consider hawkish policies that focus on direct action/military force vs diplomatic strategies which are time-consuming and slow-acting</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In general, audiovisual news contains much more emotional content than print news. This study accordingly considers this in the context of terrorism.</li>

<li>People&rsquo;s preferences for policy are driven by the emotional content of the news or information they consume, not the actual facts</li>
<li>Our information about foreign policy is taken from media sources with a high emotional context, which creates an incentive structure for our political leaders.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Specifically, political leaders will provide us with more policy that is designed to assuage our concerns. Terminally, this leads to more hawkish policy options and support for militarization.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge571237">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Decision-makers often use analogies to make decisions, but these analogies are often biased towards their personal experiences</li>
<li>Policy and decision-makers have their own toolkit of experiences which they use for analogical reasoning</li>
<li>Houghton shows the debate between different advisors to the president that use different analogies based on their separate experiences</li>
<li>From a policy standpoint, advisors often strategically employ analogies based on their policy prescriptions</li>
<li>An important characteristic of a strong leader is the ability to properly employ analogies</li>
<li>The more diverse a president&rsquo;s cabinet, the greater the diversity of analogies. Less diverse cabinets tend to be consistent and rarely differ from their general course of action
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The more diverse the cabinet, the greater the amount of analogies, which means there can be more debate to find an analogy that fits best</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Analogies must have 2 main characteristics:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Analogies must have some overlapping elements with the current problem</li>
<li>Analogies must be easy to recall and understand</li>

<h3 id="org7dbaed8">Analogical Reasoning</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7dbaed8">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Analogies are, importantly, different than metaphors. Metaphors are simple terms used to describe something. Analogies, on the other hand, define an entire context. Allow for comparison between the unfamiliar and the familiar.</li>
<li>Analogies map a familiar story to an unfamiliar situation. Elements of the story that sounds similar to the unfamiliar situation allows the <b>entire</b> story to be mapped to the afore unfamiliar situation.</li>
<li>Analogies such as this fill in lots of elements regarding incentive structures and leads to a decision. Different analogies may change the incentive structure and accordingly lead to a different decision.</li>
<li>Analogies explain the stakes, the context, moral guidance (norms and taboos), and possible policy prescriptions
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Accordingly constrain the win-set</li>
<li>Could be considered like Standard Operating Procedures (An analogy of WWII might incentivize a leader to mobilize the entire country and take the situation very seriously)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Often, debate will occur regarding the analogy that best fits the situation. Once an analogy is set, behavior can often be understood in the context of that analogy</li>
<li>Analogies among experts tend to be narrower, but for analogies to work, they don&rsquo;t have to be close to the actual situation (Iran Nuclear Deal = toddler eating vegatables)</li>
<li>If you want to select an analogy for a situation, you want the analogy to be as close as possible to that situation. Despite this, we tend to rely on analogies more when the problem is more novel.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Analogies tend to take ahold with situations when those situations are new and unfamiliar with few other overlaps</li>
</ul></li>
<li>World leaders (Obama especially) use many analogies in order to shape public opinion</li>
<li>Analogies need not be accurate for them to be used as a framework for decision-making</li>
<li>Analogies are extremely prominent in crisis decision-making</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc5fece9">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Fairnesss and fairness frames, while stable, are rarely rational</li>
<li>Culture defines fairness</li>
<li>The violation of culturally-defined fairness causes people to reject offers that are objectively good for them</li>
<li>This occurs both in cases where the offers are unfair in favor of them (though the studies here are less robust) and in cases where the offers are unfair against them (this is more common)</li>
<li>It is not necessarily that we seek fairness so much as we are averse to unfairness</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4f3add8">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is critical for our leaders to be aware of:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How they frame issues as they make decisions</li>
<li>How they frame issues when they talk to us</li>
<li>The frame our adversaries use when we are in conflict with them</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Loss-framing is a critical part of negative campaigining</li>
<li>Democratic institutions create multiple frames, which is not necessarily the case in non-democratic regimes</li>
<li>In non-democratic regimes, leaders and the public may settle into a frame (generally loss framing), which leads them to make riskier decisions</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgab47454">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When we frame outcomes in terms of gains, we tend to be risk-averse, even when the gambles are objectively better</li>
<li>When we frame outcomes in terms of losses, we tend to be risk-acceptant in order to avoid larger losses, even when the gambles are objectively worse for us</li>
<li>This can often be seen in stock market crashes and stock behavior, wherein people sell during a stock downturn when the rational decision is to hold on to the stock
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This can further be seen with (1) Carter and the Iranian Hostage Crisis, (2) The 2016 election of Trump, the 2020 election of Biden</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To remove yourself from a frame (regardless of whether it is risk-averse or risk-acceptant), it is critical to consider both benefits and losses</li>
<li>Risk aversion and prospect theory is applicable in multiple scenarios:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Leaders, themselves, have risk-aversive tendencies and follow prospect theories in their decision-making</li>
<li>The public can constrain the win-set of the leaders through their risk-aversive tendencies and tendency to follow prospect theory</li>
<li>Leaders can change the public&rsquo;s perspective on a topic through framing it in a different way and playing on prospect theory and loss aversion</li>

<li>Despite an EV of 0, the vast majority of people would not play this game</li>
<li>This is a result of loss aversion, people cognitively weigh losses and harms more than they would weigh wins and benefits</li>
<li>When compared to gains, equivalent losses hurt more</li>
<li>Pain and loss aversion is a more intense feeling than gain seeking</li>
<li>This pehnomenon is consistent across regions and cultures</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Three reasons war may occur
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>People are sometimes irrational and don&rsquo;t consider the costs of war due to this irrationality or their biases</li>
<li>Leaders may enjoy benefits of war but not pay the costs</li>
<li>People are rational and consider the risks but fight anyway (Rationalist explanation)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Flaws with contemporary rationalist arguments are that they don&rsquo;t address prewar bargains</li>
<li>Contemporary Rationalist reasons for war:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Anarchy</li>
<li>Benefits o/w costs</li>
<li>Rational preventitive war</li>
<li>Rational miscalculation due to lack of info</li>
<li>Rational miscalculation due to diagreement about relative power</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fearon&rsquo;s reasons for war
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>private or misrepresented info about relative capabilities</li>
<li>relationships are not possible because at least one party has an incentive to cheat</li>
<li>Despite being able to compromise, one or more party does not want to because of their beliefs on the issue</li>

<h3 id="orged1a9d7">The Puzzle</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orged1a9d7">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>People often see war as something nobody wants though wars can often simply be costly but worthwhile gambles</li>
<li>Wars are always ex post inefficient because no matter how small, the costs of fighting still exist</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 id="orga8d1a77">Anarchy</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga8d1a77">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>War occurs because there is nothing to prevent it</li>
<li>Does not explain why wars still occur due to their inefficiency, therefore does not explain war completely</li>
<li>Anarchy may lead to arms races and insecurity, but little war outside or preemptive war</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If a declining power suspects that it may be attacked in the future by a rising power, it will find a preventive war rational</li>

<h3 id="org4a1fa5d">Positive Expected Utility</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4a1fa5d">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Argues that war is rational when both sides have a positive expected utility from it</li>
<li>While often presented, this argument doesn&rsquo;t explain specific condition in which both parties fighting a war have positive expected utility</li>

<h3 id="orgfbca4e6">War and Private information</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfbca4e6">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>War is often the product of rational miscalculation</li>
<li>Leaders overestimate their chance of military victory</li>
<li>State lack information about other side&rsquo;s willingness to fight</li>
<li>Truly rational agents will make the same prediction about the outcome of an uncertain event when given the same set of facts
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This does not happen when miscalculation occurs, which leads to war</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There also exist incentives to misrepresent in bargaining</li>
<li>Combination of private info about relative power or will to fight and strategic incentive to misrepresent positions in baragaining constitute a rational explanation of war</li>

<h3 id="org6d0c247">War &amp; Commitment Problems</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6d0c247">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>With anarchy, states become suspicious of one another and build weapons and engage in attacks</li>
<li>Anarchy matters when it seems as if a states preferences and opportunities for action imply that one or both sides in a dispute have incentives to renege on peaceful bargains which would be mutually preferable to war</li>
<li>Preemptive war is one such case where if one wants to go to war, doing so stealthily would be the most save. While both parties would prefer to live in peace, they are constantly afraid of doing so because of the anarchic state of internaitonal affairs
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Seems to work similar to the prisoner&rsquo;s dilemm</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The same principle can be applied to preventive war, lack of trust is not the driving factor behind war in these instances. Rather, circumstances that give one party an incentive to renege are</li>

<h3 id="org01bf56d">Conclusion</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org01bf56d">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Because fighting is costly and risky, rational actors should prefer negotiations to war</li>
<li>Rational actors may be unable to agree on these negotiations because
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>private information about resolve and capability, and the incentives that exist to misrepresent these</li>
<li>inability to commit to hold ip a deal</li>

<li>Not arguing irrelevance for empirical studies concluding that war is based on irrationality</li>
