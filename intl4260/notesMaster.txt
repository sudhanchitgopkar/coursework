1.1 Public Opinion & Decision-Making
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - domestic decision-making has significant foreign policy effects
  - domestic public opinion has an effect on foreign policy decisions
    - public opinions can help shape the incentive structure that a
      decision-maker has when faced with a decision
    - public opinion can either be an opportunity or a cosntraint
  - who we listen to and what they say can intrinsically change our
    incentive structure


1.2 Putnam Review
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - For any foreign policy issue, there is a chief of government (CoG)
    - CoG has ultimate decision-making authority on the issue
    - e.g, president on war, secretary for commerce on tariffs, etc.
  - CoG's job is to find a way to align their international goals with
    what's possible domestically
    - This is the two-level game, domestic and international balances
  - "Win-Set" defines the set of acceptable outcomes that is affected by
    the policy
    - "Win-Set" defined by war and peace is the entire US population
    - "Win-Set" defined by shoe-lace imports is extremely small
  - Veto power must be considered
  - Assumes a rational actor analysis
  - While this applies largely to democratic states, the same general
    principles can also appply to authoritarian regimes

3 Fearon
========

3.1 Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - Three reasons war may occur
    - People are sometimes irrational and don't consider the costs of
      war due to this irrationality or their biases
    - Leaders may enjoy benefits of war but not pay the costs
    - People are rational and consider the risks but fight anyway
      (Rationalist explanation)
  - Flaws with contemporary rationalist arguments are that they don't
    address prewar bargains
  - Contemporary Rationalist reasons for war:
    - Anarchy
    - Benefits o/w costs
    - Rational preventitive war
    - Rational miscalculation due to lack of info
    - Rational miscalculation due to diagreement about relative power
  - Fearon's reasons for war
    - private or misrepresented info about relative capabilities
    - relationships are not possible because at least one party has an
      incentive to cheat
    - Despite being able to compromise, one or more party does not want
      to because of their beliefs on the issue


3.2 The Puzzle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - People often see war as something nobody wants though wars can often
    simply be costly but worthwhile gambles
  - Wars are always ex post inefficient because no matter how small, the
    costs of fighting still exist


3.3 Anarchy
~~~~~~~~~~~

  - War occurs because there is nothing to prevent it
  - Does not explain why wars still occur due to their inefficiency,
    therefore does not explain war completely
  - Anarchy may lead to arms races and insecurity, but little war
    outside or preemptive war


3.4 Preventive War
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - If a declining power suspects that it may be attacked in the future
    by a rising power, it will find a preventive war rational
  - Theory does not consider diplomacy and timeframe
  - Why should the declining power fear an attack if it's inefficient,
    even for the rising power


3.5 Positive Expected Utility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - Argues that war is rational when both sides have a positive expected
    utility from it
  - While often presented, this argument doesn't explain specific
    condition in which both parties fighting a war have positive
    expected utility


3.6 Utility and Rationality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - Positive expected utility alone is not enough to provide a
    rationalist explanatino for war
  - Indivisibility of factors of war can also be a rational explanation
    of war


3.7 War and Private information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - War is often the product of rational miscalculation
  - Leaders overestimate their chance of military victory
  - State lack information about other side's willingness to fight
  - Truly rational agents will make the same prediction about the
    outcome of an uncertain event when given the same set of facts
    - This does not happen when miscalculation occurs, which leads to
      war
  - There also exist incentives to misrepresent in bargaining
  - Combination of private info about relative power or will to fight
    and strategic incentive to misrepresent positions in baragaining
    constitute a rational explanation of war


3.8 War & Commitment Problems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - With anarchy, states become suspicious of one another and build
    weapons and engage in attacks
  - Anarchy matters when it seems as if a states preferences and
    opportunities for action imply that one or both sides in a dispute
    have incentives to renege on peaceful bargains which would be
    mutually preferable to war
  - Preemptive war is one such case where if one wants to go to war,
    doing so stealthily would be the most save. While both parties would
    prefer to live in peace, they are constantly afraid of doing so
    because of the anarchic state of internaitonal affairs
    - Seems to work similar to the prisoner's dilemm
  - The same principle can be applied to preventive war, lack of trust
    is not the driving factor behind war in these instances. Rather,
    circumstances that give one party an incentive to renege are


3.9 Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - Because fighting is costly and risky, rational actors should prefer
    negotiations to war
  - Rational actors may be unable to agree on these negotiations because
    - private information about resolve and capability, and the
      incentives that exist to misrepresent these
    - inability to commit to hold ip a deal
  - Not arguing irrelevance for empirical studies concluding that war is
    based on irrationality

4.1 Calculating Costs of War
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

4.1.1 Constants
---------------

  - Fight occurs over $100
  - Cost of war: $20
  - P(Winning): 50%


4.1.2 Expected Value
--------------------

  - (Gains Winning) + (Gains Fighting) - (Cost of War)
  - (0.5 * 100) + (0) - (1 * 20) = 50 - 20 = $30
  - Because each side could negotiate in order to get an expected value
    of 31 <, it is not a rational deciison to go to war


4.1.3 Miscalculation
--------------------

  - When both sides overestimate the probability of winning, their
    expected value goes up, thereby making their minimum threshold for
    negotiation too high for the other side.
  - Consider miscalculation wherein both sides believe they have an 80%
    probability of winning:
    - EV_{war} = (0.8 * 100) + (0) - (1 * 20) = 80 - 20 = 60.
    - Both sides therefore want an expected value of > 60, which is
      impossible given the limited value of the thing being fought over

==========

5.1 Rational Decision-Making
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - Rational decision-making defines how we make decisions
  - A person's or institutions goal is not relevant, the process of
    pursuing that goal is the factor driving decision-making
  - This allows us to generalize decision-making significantly more
  - Critical to consider the probabilistic nature of benefits and harms
    when considering rational decision-making
  - Expected Value = "weighted value" for all costs and benefits
    - Same thing as "average payoff"


5.2 Incentive Structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - Incentive structures are the expected values for each of the
    strategies considered
  - Incentive structures impose a certain course of action upon us,
    given that we are rational actors


6 Expected Profit Khan Academy
==============================

  - Expected value can be calculated as the sum of all the outcome
    probabilities multiplied by their corresponding profits.
  - Considering all outcome probabilities should yeild a total
    probability sum of 1 (100%), with profits being positive (gains) or
    negative (losses)


7 01.15.21
==========

  - Brain has a complex set of structures that work together to do both
    really important, and fundamentally flawed actions


7.1 Brain Stem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - The reptilian brain
  - Really just an extensino of the spinal cord
  - Controls automatic actions, no effect on decision-making


7.2 Middle Brain (Limbic System)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - Body's monitoring system to identify important elements of the
    environment
  - Discriminates things of importantance constantly and ambiently


7.3 Brain Cortex
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - Controls higher-level thinking
  - Moral decision-making, learning, conscious awareness


7.4 Hierarchy of the brain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - Information goes from the brain stem, to the limbic system, to the
    brain cortex
  - Critically, the limbic system was never designed to collect all the
    information around you - that incomplete information is used for
    decision-making
  - Understanding the interplay and potential biases of the limbic
    system can help us understand decision-making and prevent bad
    decision making
  - Fear and the triggering of fear prevents higher-level decision
    making and can prevent the intake of new information
  - Sources of information can also have a significant effect on the
    processing of that information - can be seen through
    in-group/out-group bias


7.5 Rational Decision-Making
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1. Pick a goal
  2. Evaluate all strategies
     - Analyze costs
     - Analyze benefits
  3. Select strategy with best cost/benefit ratio
  - Bias often occurs at stage 2 because of filtration of information
    through the limbic system
