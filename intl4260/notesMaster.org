- Brain has a complex set of structures that work together to do both really important, and fundamentally flawed actions
** Brain Stem
- The reptilian brain
- Really just an extensino of the spinal cord
- Controls automatic actions, no effect on decision-making
** Middle Brain (Limbic System)
- Body's monitoring system to identify important elements of the environment
- Discriminates things of importantance constantly and ambiently
** Brain Cortex
- Controls higher-level thinking
- Moral decision-making, learning, conscious awareness
** Hierarchy of the brain
- Information goes from the brain stem, to the limbic system, to the brain cortex
- Critically, the limbic system was never designed to collect all the information around you - that incomplete information is used for decision-making
- Understanding the interplay and potential biases of the limbic system can help us understand decision-making and prevent bad decision making
- Fear and the triggering of fear prevents higher-level decision making and can prevent the intake of new information
- Sources of information can also have a significant effect on the processing of that information - can be seen through in-group/out-group bias
