rmore, Friendship must be granted from one class to another. One class may not claim that it is the friend of another and access that class' data. Rather, the original class must establish that the other is its friend. Moreover, friendship is neither symmetric nor transitive. Class A may be a friend of Class B while Class B may not be a friend of Class A. Simply because Class A is a friend of Class B and Class B is a friend of Class C does not mean that Class A is also a friend of Class C.

4. A static data member must be initialized exactly once and are initialized by default to 0.

5.
(a) Constructors are called following program execution before any other functions
Destructors are called when the main function ends

(b) Constructors are called when the line with the object is defined executes
    Destructors are called when the program is no longer within the object's scope

(c) Constructors are called only once when the line with the object is defined executes
    Destructors are called the main function ends/ when the exit function is called

6. The compiler creates its own default, non-explicit copy constructor

7) Copy constructors copy an object's values into a new object. The default copy constructor copies each individual member of some object into its own, new corresponding member of the new object.
(i) Problems can arise with copy constructers when used in a situation where the data members use pointers to dynamically allocated memory

8) Constructor delegation occurs when one constructor calls another constructor within that class to minimizes redundant code. This is done as follows: syntax: constructorName(...) : otherConstructorName(...)

9) The include guard ensures that variables and functions that may have the same name are defined properly and can be compiled without issue. Without this, functions with the same name in two different classes could be confused with one another and wouldn't compile.
